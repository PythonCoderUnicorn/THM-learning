#BurpSuite 

Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing.

Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server.

-  web and mobile applications

Burp Suite Community features
- Proxy = interception and modification of requests & responses
- Repeater = captures , modifies and resends same request multiple times, useful for SQL payloads
- Intruder = allows for spraying endpoints with requests (brute force attacks, fuzzing) 
- Decoder = decodes captured info or encodes payloads before sending  to target
- Comparer = compares 2 data either word or byte level
- Sequencer = assess the randomness of tokens, session cookies or other data


BurpSuite dashboard
- Tasks = allows you to define background tasks
- Event Log = history of action performed 
- Issue activity = only for professional version does this matter
- advisory = detailed info about ID'd vulns

BURP PROXY
captures user and target web server, captured traffic can be manipulated 

Intercepting Requests:
- requests are held from reaching target server and show in Proxy tab (then can drop, edit , send)
- `intercept is on` toggle on/off 

Match and Replace: 
The "Match and Replace" section in the **Proxy settings** enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.

FoxyProxy browser extension

Add+ 
- Title BurpSuite
- Proxy IP: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `8080`
- save 
- BurpSuite has to be running `intercept is on` > Foxy proxy > Burp > go to website (website will hang but proxy will load) 
- right click on any request allows further actions 


` 10.10.114.159 `

Target tab
- Site map = map of the web app in a tree structure, useful for API endpoints
- Issue definitions = list of vulnerabilities the scanner looks for , a resource
- Scope settings = control the target in scope, include or exclude specific domains/ IPs to define the scope of our testing (capture only traffic you need)

in browser with Foxy proxy on `http://10.10.114.159`
Target > Site map
```
http://10.10.114.159

L /about/
L /assets/
L /contact/
L /products/
L /ticket/
```

- click on a button or 2, Proxy > Intercept > Forward ( a few times )
- `/5yjR2GLcoGoij2ZK`   this appears after clicking on buttons
- Repeater shows ` THM{NmNlZTliNGE1MWU1ZTQzMzgzNmFiNWVk} `

if you are running Burp Suite on Linux as the root user
you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting due to the inability to create a sandbox environment.
- Settings > Tools > Burp Browser > check all Burp's browser to run without a sandbox (be cautious!)
----

Scoping
- Target > Site map
- `https://tryhackme.com` right click > add to scope > yes
- Proxy tab > settings > Request interception rules: check `And URL is in target scope` 

Proxying HTTPS
- when going to a HTTPS domain may get an error regarding Portswigger Certificate Authority is not authorized to secure the connection
- in browser `http://burp/cert` which downloads `cacert.der` 
- Firefox settings > search `certificates` > view certificates > import downloaded certificate > Trust the CA > ok


EXAMPLE ATTACK
- `10.10.114.159/ticket`
- Support contact form `email` and `text box`
- Try typing: ` <script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script> `, into the "Contact Email" field.

bypass a filter
- Proxy is on 
- in the browser enter data `fake@email.com` and `attack!`
- Burp suite Proxy > Intercept shows email and content entered (request is being held) 
- now we can edit email to have SQL injection

```
POST /ticket/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.114.159
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
...
email=fake%40email.com&content=attack

~~~~ change email to the SQL injection
email=<script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>&content=attack

--Forward x3 = pop up!
```

then you get a pop up `Succ3ssful XSS`
