One of the challenges when analyzing potentially malicious software is that we risk our machine or environment being compromised when we run it unless we have a sandbox or a completely isolated environment where we can test all we want. Generally speaking, there are two types of analysis: <span style="color:#a0f958">dynamic analysis and static analysis.</span> This room will focus on conducting static analysis using a tool called CAPA.


<span style="color:#a0f958">CAPA (Common Analysis Platform for Artifacts) i</span>s a tool developed by the FireEye Mandiant team. It is designed to **identify the capabilities** present in executable files like Portable Executables (PE), ELF binaries, .NET modules, shellcode, and even sandbox reports. It does so by analyzing the file and applying a set of rules that **describe common behaviours**, allowing it to determine what the **program is capable of doing**, such as **network communication**, **file manipulation**, **process injection**, and many more.

The beauty of CAPA is that it encapsulates years of reverse engineering knowledge into an automated tool, making it accessible even to those who may not be experts in reverse engineering. This can be incredibly useful for analysts and security professionals, allowing them to quickly understand potentially malicious software's functionality without manually reverse engineering the code.

This tool is particularly useful in malware analysis and threat hunting, where understanding a binary's capabilities is crucial for incident response and defensive measures.



> [!info] Note that inside this VM, we have installed CAPA so you can get a feel for running the tool and experiment further with the different command parameters. However, it takes a long time to finish using the attached VM. Hence, we have pre-processed the reports such as the following:

- **cryptbot.txt**
- **cryptbot_vv.txt**
- **cryptbot_vv.json**

And placed them under the directory `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa.` Almost all the files we will use in this room are in the said directory.


In this task, we will see how to use CAPA.  Running the tool is as easy as 1..2..3.  First, open a PowerShell, noting that it might take a while before the prompt appears. Next is to make sure that you are in the correct directory (`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa`); then you need to run `capa` or `capa.exe`, then point to the binary, and that’s it!

In this example, we will use **cryptbot.bin;** please note that the results of this file will be discussed throughout the succeeding task.

After running the command, wait for the result, which may take several minutes. **We don't intend this to finish but rather to let you get a feel for running the tool**, so we suggest that you continue the task while CAPA is running or stop the processing. There are alternative ways to proceed with the analysis of the results. See the command below.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> capa.exe .\cryptbot.bin
```

```
capa -h --help
capa -v --verbose
```


```
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> Get-Content .\cryptbot.txt
```


```
What command-line option would you use if you need to check what other parameters you can use with the tool? Use the shortest format.

GET-CONTENT

```

## capa - part 3

```
Which top-level Namespace contains a set of rules specifically designed to detect behaviours, including obfuscation, packing, and anti-debugging techniques exhibited by malware to evade analysis?

anti-analysis


Which namespace contains rules to detect virtual machine (VM) environments? Note that this is not the TLN or Top-Level Namespace.

anti-vm/vm-detection


Which Top-Level Namespace contains rules related to behaviours associated with maintaining access or persistence within a compromised system? This namespace is focused on understanding how malware can establish and maintain a presence within a compromised environment, allowing it to persist and carry out malicious activities over an extended period.
