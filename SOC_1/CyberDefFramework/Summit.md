Well, that's it. I have officially given up.

Throughout the engagement, you managed to chase me to the very top of the Pyramid of Pain, and I have to say, it's not fun up here!

You detected my samples file hashes, IPs, domains, host artifacts, tools, and now my own behavioural techniques! To continue, I have no choice but to completely retrain myself and conduct extensive research to figure out how you're catching me. And with that, I don't think you'll ever see me again. Enjoy the final flag; you've earned it!

Here's your flag: THM{c8951b2ad24bbcbac60c16cf2c83d92c}
