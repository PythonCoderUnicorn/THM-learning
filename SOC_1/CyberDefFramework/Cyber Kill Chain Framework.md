## Recon 

**Reconnaissance** is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries.

**OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. OSINT is the first step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack. The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack.

- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources 
- [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) - this is  an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories

An attacker would also use social media websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect information on a specific victim he would want to attack or the company. The information found on social media can be beneficial for an attacker to conduct a phishing attack.

## weaponization 

Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or refer to the [DarkWeb] to purchase the malware. More sophisticated actors or nation-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) would write their custom malware to make the malware sample unique and evade detection on the target.

**Malware** is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer.

An **exploit** is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system.

A **payload** is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system.

## delivery 

attacker decides to choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. He has plenty of options to choose from:

- phishing email
- distributing infected USB in public 
- water hole attack -  is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice. The attacker would look for a known vulnerability for the website and try to exploit it. The attacker would encourage the victims to visit the website by sending "harmless" emails pointing out the malicious URL to make the attack work more efficiently. After visiting the website, the victim would unintentionally download malware or a malicious application to their computer. This type of attack is called a drive-by download. An example can be a malicious pop-up asking to download a fake Browser extension.


## exploitation 

attacker created two phishing emails, one that contains a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page and another one containing a macro attachment that would execute ransomware when the victim opens it. "Megatron" successfully delivered his exploits and got two victims to click on the malicious link and open the malicious file.

After gaining access to the system, the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network.

examples of how an attacker carries out exploitation:
- The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link.
- Using a zero-day exploit.
- Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. 
- An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities.


## installation 

Once the attacker gets access to the system, he would want to reaccess the system if he loses the connection to it or if he got detected and got the initial access removed, or if the system is later patched. A persistent backdoor will let the attacker access the system he compromised in the past.

The persistence can be achieved through:
- Installing a **web shell** on the webserver. A web shell is a malicious script written in web development programming languages such as ASP, PHP, or JSP used by an attacker to maintain access to the compromised system. Because of the web shell simplicity and file formatting (.php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, etc.) can be difficult to detect and might be classified as benign.
- Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine. For example, the attacker can use [Meterpreter](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-backdoor/) to install a backdoor on the victim's machine. Meterpreter is a Metasploit Framework payload that gives an interactive shell from which an attacker can interact with the victim's machine remotely and execute the malicious code.
- Adding the entry to the "run keys" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder.
- 


## command & control 

Command and Control channel through the malware to remotely control and manipulate the victim. This term is also known as **C&C or C2 Beaconing** as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host. The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server; that is also where the beaconing term came from.

- The protocols HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443 - this type of beaconing blends the malicious traffic with the legitimate traffic and can help the attacker evade firewalls.    
    
- DNS (Domain Name Server). The infected machine makes constant DNS requests to the DNS server that belongs to an attacker, this type of C2 communication is also known as DNS Tunneling.


## actions on objectives 

With hands-on keyboard access, the attacker can achieve the following: 

- Collect the credentials from users.
- Perform privilege escalation (gaining elevated access like domain administrator access from a workstation by exploiting the misconfiguration).
- Internal reconnaissance (for example, an attacker gets to interact with internal software to find its vulnerabilities).
- Lateral movement through the company's environment.
- Collect and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- Deleting the backups and shadow copies. Shadow Copy is a Microsoft technology that can create backup copies, snapshots of computer files, or volumes. 
- Overwrite or corrupt data.
