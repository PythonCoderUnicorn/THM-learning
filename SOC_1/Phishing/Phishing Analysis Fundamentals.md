#FreeRoom #Phishing 
https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails1tryoe

Spam and Phishing are common social engineering attacks. In social engineering, phishing attack vectors can be a phone call, a text message, or an email. As you should have already guessed, our focus is on email as the attack vector. 

We all should be somewhat familiar with what **spam** is. No matter what, these emails somehow find their way into our inboxes. 

The first email classified as spam dates back to 1978  [https://www.britannica.com/topic/spam], and it's still thriving today.   

**Phishing** is a serious attack vector that you, as a defender, will have to defend against.

An organization can follow all the recommended guidelines when it comes to building a layered defense strategy. Still, all it takes is an inexperienced and unsuspecting user within your corporate environment to click on a link or download and run a malicious attachment which may provide an attacker a foothold into the network. 

Many products help combat spam and phishing, but realistically these emails still can get through. When they do, as a Security Analyst, you need to know how to analyze these emails to determine if they're malicious or benign.

Furthermore, you will need to gather information about the email to update your security products to prevent malicious emails from making their way back into a user's inbox. 

In this room, we'll look at all the components involved with sending emails across the Internet and how to analyze email headers.



## email address 

It's only appropriate to start this room by mentioning the man who invented the concept of emails and made the @ symbol famous. The person responsible for the contribution to the way we communicate was Ray Tomlinson. 

The invention of the email dates back to the 1970s for [ARPANET](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET). Yep, probably before you were born. Definitely, before I was born. :)

## email delivery

A handful of protocols are involved with the "magic" that takes place when you hit SEND in an email client. 

By now, you should already know that certain protocols were created to handle specific network-related tasks, such as email. 

There are 3 specific protocols involved to facilitate the outgoing and incoming email messages, and they are briefly listed below.

- **SMTP** (**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** - It is utilized to handle the sending of emails. 
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol)** - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server. 
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** - Is responsible transferring email between a client and a mail server.

**POP3**
- Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.
- Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.
- Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.
- If you want to keep messages on the server, make sure the setting "Keep email on server" is enabled, or all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded to the single device's app or software.

**IMAP**
- Emails are stored on the server and can be downloaded to multiple devices.
- Sent messages are stored on the server.
- Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices.

```
1. user@emaildomain.com
2. SMTP server (port 25) 
3. DNS server
4. SMTP server
5. firewall
6. internet
7. firewall
8. SMTP server
9. POP3/IMAP server
10. user2@otherdomain.com

secure IMAP port 993
secure SMTP port 465
secure POP3 port 995
```


## email headers 

Before we begin, we need to understand that there are two parts to an email:
- the email **header** (information about the email, such as the email servers that relayed the email)
- the email **body** (text and/or HTML formatted text)

The syntax for email messages is known as the **[Internet Message Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322)** (**IMF**).

Let's look at email headers first. 

**Note**: Depending on your email client, whether a web client or a desktop app, the steps to view these email header fields will vary, but the concept is the same. 

Review this Knowledge Base (KB) article from Media Temple on viewing the raw/full email headers in various email clients [here](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/grid/204644060/how-do-i-view-email-headers-for-a-message).

What do you look for when analyzing a potentially malicious email?  

Let's start with the following email header fields:
1. **From** - the sender's email address
2. **Subject** - the email's subject line
3. **Date** - the date when the email was sent
4. **To** - the recipient's email address

You can review this email in the `Email Samples` directory on the Desktop within the attached virtual machine. The email is titled `email1.eml`.   

From the above image, there are other email header fields of interest. 

1. **X-Originating-IP** - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an **[X-header](https://help.returnpath.com/hc/en-us/articles/220567127-What-are-X-headers-)**)
2. **Smtp.mailfrom**/**header.from** - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within **Authentication-Results**)
3. **Reply-To** - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the **From** email address

To clarify, in the email in the sample above, the **Sender** is newsletters@ant.anki-tech.com, but if a recipient replies to the email, the response will go to reply@ant.anki-tech.com, which is the **Reply-To**, and **NOT** to newsletters@ant.anki-tech.com.

## types of phishing

Now that we covered the general concepts regarding emails and how they travel from sender to recipient, we can now talk about how this method of communication is used for nefarious purposes. 

Different types of malicious emails can be classified as one of the following:

- **[Spam](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam)** - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as **MalSpam**.
- **[Phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/phishing)** -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 
- **[Spear phishing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spear-phishing) -** takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  
- **[Whaling](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/whaling-phishing-attacks/)** - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 
- [**Smishing**](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/smishing) - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 
- [**Vishing**](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/vishing) - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls.

When it comes to phishing, the modus operandi is usually the same depending on the objective of the email.

For example, the objective can be to harvest credentials, and another is to gain access to the computer. 

Below are typical characteristics phishing emails have in common:

- The **sender email name/address** will masquerade as a trusted entity (**[email spoofing](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/email-spoofing)**)
- The email subject line and/or body (text) is written with a **sense of urgency** or uses certain keywords such as **Invoice**, **Suspended**, etc. 
- The email body (HTML) is designed to match a trusting entity (such as Amazon)
- The email body (HTML) is poorly formatted or written (contrary from the previous point)
- The email body uses generic content, such as Dear Sir/Madam. 
- **Hyperlinks** (oftentimes uses URL shortening services to hide its true origin)
- A [malicious attachment](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malicious-email-attachments) posing as a legitimate document

We'll look at each of these techniques (characteristics) in greater detail in the next room within the Phishing module.

**Reminder**: When dealing with hyperlinks and attachments, you need to be careful not to accidentally click on the hyperlink or the attachment. 

Hyperlinks and IP addresses should be '**defanged**'. Defanging is a way of making the URL/domain or email address unclickable to avoid accidental clicks, which may result in a serious security breach. It replaces special characters, like "@" in the email or "." in the URL, with different characters. For example, a highly suspicious domain, http://www.suspiciousdomain.com, will be changed to hxxp[://]www[.]suspiciousdomain[.]com before forwarding it to the SOC team for detection.
