#Phishing #FreeRoom 
https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingemails2rytmuv


Now that we covered the basics concerning emails in [Phishing Emails 1](http://tryhackme.com/jr/phishingemails1tryoe), let's dive right into actual phishing email samples. 

Each email sample showcased in this room will demonstrate different tactics used to make the phishing emails look legitimate. The more convincing the phishing email appears, the higher the chances the recipient will click on a malicious link, download and execute the malicious file, or even send the prince of some country a wire transfer. 

> [!warning] Warning: 
> The samples throughout this room contain information from actual spam and/or phishing emails. Proceed with caution if you attempt to interact with any IP, domain, attachment, etc.

The email sample in this task will highlight the following techniques:  

```
Spoofed email address
URL shortening services
HTML to impersonate a legitimate brand

----------------------------------------------
Your Receipt for Payment to Amazing stuff
- - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - 
service@paypal.com <noreplyexhmhkhs@<s7sh...>@sultanbogor.com
To: 0008812033347779xxxxxid@mail.info.cnsmr.sg3.yahoo.net

----------------------------------------------

1. This is an unusual email recipient address. This is not the email address associated with the Yahoo account. 

2. This mismatch should immediately stand out. The sender's details (service@paypal.com) don't match the sender's email address (gibberish@sultanbogor.com). 

3. The subject line hints that you made a purchase or a transaction of some sort. If you don't recall this account, then it will grab your attention. This social engineering tactic is to prompt you to interact with the email with haste.

Track your package: # LZ8942357ENN
----------------------------------

1. The email is tailored to appear that it's sent from a mail distribution center of some sort. 
2. The subject line adds to the pretense with a 'tracking number.' 
3. The link in the email body matches the subject line.

```

The recipient email looks like another spoofed email to appear as a legitimate Apple email address.
