Cyber Threat Intelligence is typically a managerial mystery to handle, with organisations battling with how to input, digest, analyse and present threat data in a way that will make sense.

[OpenCTI](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti) is another open-sourced platform designed to provide organisations with the means to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware and IOCs.

OpenCTI Data Model

Structured Threat Info Expression (STIX2) is serialized and standardized language format used in threat intel exchange
