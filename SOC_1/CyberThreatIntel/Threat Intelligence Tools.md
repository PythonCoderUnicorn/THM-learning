## Abuse.ch

a research project hosted by the Institute for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project. These platforms are:

- **Malware Bazaar:**  A resource for sharing malware samples.
- **Feodo Tracker:**  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
- **SSL Blacklist:**  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
- **URL Haus:**  A resource for sharing malware distribution sites.
- **Threat Fox:**  A resource for sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).


MALWARE BAZAAR
- malware samples database 
- malware hunting samples

URL HAUS
- malicious URLs database, hashes and filetypes

THREAT FOX
- indicators of malware in JSON and CSV format



- https://threatfox.abuse.ch/
- https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/
- https://sslbl.abuse.ch/
- https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/
- https://bazaar.abuse.ch/


```
Search through the ThreatFox database using the syntax ioc:<ip here> and you will find the malware alias name.

The IOC 212.192.246.30:5555 is identified under which malware alias name on ThreatFox?

ioc: 212.192.246.30
Malware = Katana (Mirai)


  
Which malware is associated with the JA3 Fingerprint 51c64c77e60f3980eea90869b68c58a8 on SSL Blacklist?

Malware = Dridex


  
From the statistics page on URLHaus, what malware-hosting network has the ASN number AS14061 ?

digitalocean-ASN


  
Which country is the botnet IP address 178.134.47.166 associated with according to FeodoTracker?

GE = georgia

## PhishTool

Start Machine

[PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/) seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.
