SOC Analyst **Johny** has observed some anomalous behaviours in the logs of a few windows machines. It looks like the adversary has access to some of these machines and successfully created some backdoor. His manager has asked him to pull those logs from suspected hosts and ingest them into Splunk for quick investigation. Our task as SOC Analyst is to examine the logs and identify the anomalies.

To learn more about Splunk and how to investigate the logs, look at the rooms [splunk101](https://tryhackme.com/room/splunk101) and [splunk201](https://tryhackme.com/room/splunk201).
