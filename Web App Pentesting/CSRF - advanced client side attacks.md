https://tryhackme.com/r/room/csrfV2


Welcome to a world where launching web attacks is so easy that even beginners (like script kiddies) can write simple scripts to hack into big businesses. These attacks are like sneaky tricks that can cause much trouble online. In this room, we will focus on one such web attack called **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF)**. We will understand various exploitation techniques of CSRF and protection measures for its prevention.

We use a vulnerable online banking application throughout the room to perform the exercise practically and become familiar with various CSRF attacks. Please wait 1-2 minutes after the system boots completely to let the auto scripts run successfully. The following hostnames have already been added to the attached VM:

```
online banking app  mybank.thm:8080
mailbox app         mailbox.thm:8081
attacker panel      attacker.mybank.thm:8080 
```


## overview 

### what is CSRF ?

CSRF is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a user's web browser into performing an unwanted action on a trusted site where the user is authenticated. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the browser includes any relevant cookies (credentials) automatically, allowing the attacker to forge and submit unauthorised requests on behalf of the user (through the browser). The attacker's website may contain HTML forms or JavaScript code that is intended to send queries to the targeted web application.

A CSRF attack has **three** essential phases:

- The attacker already knows the format of the web application's requests to carry out a particular task and sends a malicious link to the user.
- The victim's identity on the website is verified, typically by cookies transmitted automatically with each domain request and clicks on the link shared by the attacker. This interaction could be a click, mouse over, or any other action.

```
attacker 
L sends malicious link to user 
	L user authenticated
		L user clicks on fraudulent link
			L server returns request (regardless of falsified)
```


Effects of CSRF

Understanding CSRF's impact is crucial for keeping online activities secure. Although CSRF attacks don't directly expose user data, they can still cause harm by changing passwords and email addresses or making financial transactions. The risks associated with CSRF include:
- **Unauthorised Access**: Attackers can access and control a user's actions, putting them at risk of losing money, damaging their reputation, and facing legal consequences.
- **Exploiting Trust**: CSRF exploits the trust websites put in their users, undermining the sense of security in online browsing.
- **Stealthy Exploitation**: CSRF works quietly, using standard browser behaviour without needing advanced malware. Users might be unaware of the attack, making them susceptible to repeated exploitation.

Understanding these risks is essential for implementing effective measures to protect web applications from CSRF vulnerabilities.


### types of CSRF attack

#### traditional CSRF

Conventional CSRF attacks frequently concentrate on state-changing actions carried out by submitting forms. The victim is tricked into submitting a form without realising the associated data like cookies, URL parameters, etc. The victim's web browser sends an HTTP request to a web application form where the victim has already been authenticated. These forms are made to transfer money, modify account information, or alter an email address.

```
Victim: 
user logs in   https://www.mybank.thm

Attacker: 
creates malicious email link 
<a href="http://mybank.thm/transfer?amount=100&accountNumber=1011"> You Won $100 gift card </a>

Victim: 
opens email in same browser as bank login (new tab)
--> $ gets transfered
```

#### XML HTTPRequest 

An asynchronous CSRF exploitation occurs when operations are initiated without a complete page request-response cycle. This is typical of contemporary online apps that leverage asynchronous server communication (via **XMLHttpRequest** or the **Fetch** API) and JavaScript to produce more dynamic user interfaces. These attacks use asynchronous calls instead of the more conventional form submissions. Still, they exploit the same trust relationship between the user and the online service.

Consider an online email client, for instance, where users may change their email preferences without reloading the page. If this online application is CSRF-vulnerable, a hacker might create a fake asynchronous HTTP request, usually a POST request, and alter the victim's email preferences, forwarding all their correspondence to a malicious address.

The following is a simplified overview of the steps that an asynchronous CSRF attack could take:
```
Victim:
opens a session saved in browser's cookies and logs into the mailbox

Attacker:
gets victim to open malicious webpage with a script that can send queries to mailbox, which modifies the user's email preferences.
the session cookie is included in the AJAX request in victim's browser

Victim:
opens malicious webpage, the AJAX request is made and mailbox modifies user's email preferences
```

#### Adobe Flash based CSRF

The term "Flash-based CSRF" describes the technique of conducting a CSRF attack by taking advantage of flaws in Adobe Flash Player components. Internet applications with features like **interactive content, video streaming, and intricate animations** have been made possible with Flash. But over time, security flaws in Flash, particularly those that can be used to launch CSRF attacks, have become a major source of worry. As HTML5 technology advanced and security flaws multiplied, official support for Adobe Flash Player ceased on [December 31, 2020](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html).

Even though Flash is no longer supported, a talk about Flash-based cross-site request forgery threats is instructive, particularly for legacy systems that still rely on antiquated technologies. A **malicious Flash file (.swf)** posted on the attacker's website would typically send unauthorised requests to other websites to carry out Flash-based CSRF attacks.

## basic CSRF - hidden link

Overview

A covert technique known as **hidden link/image exploitation** in CSRF involves an attacker inserting a 0x0 pixel image or a link into a webpage that is nearly undetectable to the user. Typically, the `src or href` element of the image is set to a destination URL intended to act on the user's behalf without the user's awareness. It takes benefit of the fact that the user's browser transfers credentials like cookies automatically.

```html
<!-- Website --> 
<a href="https://mybank.thm/transfer.php" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  
<!-- User visits attacker's website while authenticated -->
```

> [!info] This technique preys on authenticated sessions and utilises a social engineering approach when a user may inadvertently perform operations on a different website while still logged in.

How it works

- The attached VM represents Josh's machine, who uses Chrome to check his mailbox (`http://mailbox.thm:8081`) and log into his bank account (`http://mybank.thm:8080`). Since he is a financial broker by profession, he deals with many financial transactions daily and keeps his accounts logged into the browser.   
- The attacker somehow learns that Josh uses `mybank.thm:8080` for transactions, and his account is always logged in.  
- The attacker also had an account in the same bank, so he tried to log in and check for any vulnerabilities that he could use to get additional cash in his account.
- You can also log in to Firefox in the attached VM or any other browser using the username `GB82MYBANK5698` and password `GB82MYBANK5698` to understand the attacker's perspective and check the source code and how the client-side scripts work.
- While scanning, he found that no additional parameter was being sent from the bank app while transferring payment. Here is the code that handles the transfer of funds:

```php
<?php 
<form action="transfer.php" method="post"> 
	<label for="to_account">To Account:</label> 
	<input type="text" id="to_account" name="to_account" required> 
	
	<label for="amount">Amount:</label> 
	<input type="number" id="amount" name="amount" required> 
	
	<button type="submit">Transfer</button> 
</form>
```

- Here, the attacker can employ the hidden image technique by simply crafting an email and luring the victim to click on a link. The attacker only knows Josh's email address, so he launches a social engineering attack by sending the following email to him.

anchor tag 
```html
<a href="http://mybank.thm:8080/dashboard.php?to_account=GB82MYBANK5698&amount=1000" target="_blank">Click Here to Redeem</a>
```

- To understand the victim's perspective, navigate to Josh's mailbox at the `mailbox.thm:8081` to see a new email stating that he has won a trip to Dubai and to claim it, he has to click on a link directed to the MyBank vulnerable page without having CSRF protection.
- Once you (in reality, the victim) click on the link, he will be redirected to the bank page, and the funds will be transferred automatically.

> [!info] All the validations are correct and accurate; however, the server is not validating if the request comes from a legitimate user.

Securing the Breach

- From a **pentester/red teamer perspective**, it is vital to pentest each request and response parameter of the form.  
- From a **secure coder perspective**, it is important to ensure that each request submitted to the web server carries a unique token so that the server can identify if it is clicked through a valid source.
- The bank IT team quickly identified the issue and added a CSRF token with each request submitted to the server. The following code contains the updated client-side code. We can see that there is an additional hidden parameter, `csrf_token`, which will be sent to the server with each request.

```html
<form method="post" action="">
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="current_password" required>

        <label for="confirm_password">ConfirmPassword:</label>
        <input type="password" id="confirm_password" name="confirm_password" required>
		<input type="hidden" id="csrf_token" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $_COOKIE['csrf-token']; ?>">
        <button type="submit" name="password_submit" >Update Password</button>
    </form>submit">
</form> 
```
- On the server side, the server will verify if each incoming request contains the unique token; otherwise, it will reject the request.
- Open Josh's mailbox and navigate to the attacker's email with a green badge.
- When the user clicks on the link, it won't transfer the funds as the request is missing a unique CSRF token required to validate the request.

## double submit cookie bypass

Overview

We've observed that without CSRF tokens, the bank web application was susceptible to vulnerabilities, exposing it to potential exploitation. However, the introduction of CSRF tokens significantly enhances security measures.

A CSRF token is a unique, unpredictable value associated with a user's session, ensuring each request comes from a legitimate source. One effective implementation is the **[Double Submit Cookies technique](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#alternative-using-a-double-submit-cookie-pattern)**, where a cookie value corresponds to a value in a hidden form field. When the server receives a request, it checks that the cookie value matches the form field value, providing an additional layer of verification.


How it works

- **Token Generation**: When a user logs in or initiates a session, the server generates a unique CSRF token. This token is sent to the user's browser both as a cookie (CSRF-Token cookie) and embedded in hidden form fields of web forms where actions are performed (like money transfers).
- **User Action**: Suppose the user wants to transfer money. They fill out the transfer form on the website, which includes the hidden CSRF token.
- **Form Submission**: Upon submitting the form, two versions of the CSRF token are sent to the server: one in the cookie and the other as part of the form data.
- **Server Validation**: The server then checks if the CSRF token in the cookie matches the one sent in the form data. If they match, the request is considered legitimate and processed; if not, the request is rejected.

```
(attacker's CSRF cookie) + (Request) + (Attacker known token CSRF payload) --> match request accepted
```

Possible Vulnerable Scenarios

Despite its effectiveness, it's crucial to acknowledge that hackers are persistent and have identified various methods to bypass Double Submit Cookies:

- Session Cookie Hijacking (Man in the Middle Attack): If the CSRF token is not appropriately isolated and safeguarded from the session, an attacker may also be able to access it by other means (such as malware, network spying, etc.).
- **Subverting the Same-Origin Policy (Attacker Controlled Subdomain)**: An attacker can set up a situation where the browser's same-origin policy is broken. Browser vulnerabilities or deceiving the user into sending a request through an attacker-controlled subdomain with permission to set cookies for its parent domain could be used.
- **Exploiting XSS Vulnerabilities**: An attacker may be able to obtain the CSRF token from the cookie or the page itself if the web application is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By creating fraudulent requests with the double-submitted cookie CSRF token, the attacker can get around the defence once they have the CSRF token.
- **Predicting or Interfering with Token Generation**: An attacker may be able to guess or modify the CSRF token if the tokens are not generated securely and are predictable or if they can tamper with the token generation process.
- **Subdomain Cookie Injection**: Injecting cookies into a user's browser from a related subdomain is another potentially sophisticated technique that might be used. This could fool the server's CSRF protection system by appearing authentic to the main domain.

In this task, we will use one of the above techniques to bypass a variant of the Double Submit cookie technique.

How it Works

Now, we will see how the attack works, connecting it to the previous example. This technique will chain two vulnerable scenarios by reversing token generation and injecting a cookie through an attacker-controlled subdomain. 

- The attacker has successfully transferred the amount from Josh's bank account but seems more greedy and wants to take complete control of the bank account.
- To exploit the account, the attacker must access the bank account. But how? This requires the password of the Josh account.
- Exploiting a vulnerability like CSRF requires a lot of code and functionality and understanding the website logic from the developer's point of view. The attacker logged into his bank account and noticed that the form for updating passwords is protected through a CSRF- token.

```html
<form method="post" action="">
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="new_password" required>

        <label for="confirm_password">ConfirmPassword:</label>
        <input type="password" id="confirm_password" name="confirm_password" required>
		<input type="hidden" id="csrf_token" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $_COOKIE['csrf-token']; ?>">
        <button type="submit" name="password_submit" >Update Password</button>
    </form>submit">
</form> 
```

- But does that ultimately resolve the problem? An attacker can only bypass this security measure if he finds a way to reverse-engineer the token.
- He opens the Chrome built-in `Inspect element` console to verify the cookies created locally by the website.
```
Browser > Application > Cookies
Name csrf-token 
PHPSESSID
```
- The attackers identified two relevant cookies created in the browser: `csrf-token` and `PHPSESSID`. Typically, the PHPSESSID is randomly generated by the PHP engine itself, and it is not very easy to reverse it for session hijacking. Consequently, the attacker copied his token and noticed if he could reverse engineer it.  
- He used [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)&input=UjBJNE1rMVpRa0ZPU3pVMk9UZ0s) to see if he could decode the string and, surprisingly, noticed that the CSRF token was a string he could decrypt.
- He noticed that the string decoded from the token was his bank account number, meaning the web application developer needed to implement CSRF tokens better to avoid exploitation. We know that the attacker already has access to the subdomain of `mybank.thm` which can help him inject the cookie and has already reverse-engineered the cookie. Now, it's time to prepare a payload. 
- ` GB82MYBANK5698 `

**Preparing Payload**

- For the attack to work, the attacker would use the social engineering technique to make the victim click on a link.
- The attacker will prepare an enticing email to compel the user to change his password. He prepared an email citing a suspicious login attempt to Josh email and sent it to Josh.
- The email contained a link to an **attacker-controlled domain** (`attacker.mybank.thm`) with a password update form similar to a bank one. The form also has a CSRF token already set as a hidden parameter.

```html
<form method="post" action="http://mybank.thm:8080//changepassword.php" id="autos">
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="current_password" value="<?php echo "GB82MYBANK5697" ?>" required>

        <label for="confirm_password">ConfirmPassword:</label>
        <input type="password" id="confirm_password" name="confirm_password" value="Attacker Unique Password" required>
		<input type="hidden" id="csrf_token" name="csrf_token" value="Decrypted Token Value">
		

        <button type="submit" name="password_submit"  id="password_submit" >Update Password</button>
    </form>
	
	</div>
<script>
document.getElementById('password_submit').click(); 
</script>
```

- In the above code, the attacker will update the payload and add the `base64 value` of Josh's bank account as a new CSRF token value. 
- Navigate to Josh's mailbox at the `mailbox.thm:8081` to see the new mail with the crafted CSRF payload. `vulnerable Mark K. Urgent: Action Required - Suspicious Login Attempt Detected`
- Once you click the link, it will redirect you to the attacker-controlled subdomain page and auto-submit the form to change the password. The attacker contains a code similar to that of the change password page of `mybank.thm`; however, he is also setting a cookie with the following code so that it will be forwarded to the main domain `mybank.thm` while triggering a CSRF attack.

```php
<?php
...
setcookie(
    'csrf-token',               
    base64_encode("GB82MYBANK5699"),            
    [
        'expires' => time() + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60), 
        'path' => '/',                         
        'domain' => 'mybank.thm',                          
        'secure' => false,                      
        'httponly' => false,                 
        'samesite' => 'Lax' 
    ]
);
?>
```

- The attacker knows the hidden form parameter, and the form will submit all the data, including the hidden fields, to the original change password page of `mybank.thm:8080`. Following is the server-side code, let's see what is happening on the server:

```php
<?php
if (base64_decode($_POST["csrf_token"]) == base64_decode($_COOKIE['csrf-token'])) { 
// Retrieve form data
$currentPassword = $_POST["current_password"];
$newPassword = $_POST["confirm_password"];
// Update Password
...;
```

- As we see in the above code, the server will decode the CSRF token and compare it with the cookie value. The server hosting `mybank.thm:8080` will consider the request legitimate as it comes from a logged-in user, and the CSRF token is also valid and will update the password.

> [!info] **Note**: For ease, the server request headers are displayed on the webpage to understand received cookies and form data.

What was the missing link?

The server-side script correctly validated the user; however, the CSRF token was easy to predict, and therefore, the attacker could launch a crafted CSRF attack.  

Securing the Breach

- From a **pentester/red teamer perspective**, it is essential to validate the complete flow of HTTP request/response, double check the request parameters for any possible vulnerability like easy-to-guess tokens and invalid input, and scrutinize the client-side JavaScript code for potential issues.  
- From a **secure coder perspective**, ensuring that the token generation methods generate extremely unique and hard-to-guess tokens is essential. 
- The bank IT team quickly identified the issue and updated the token generation algorithm to remain unique and hard to predict.
- Open Josh's mailbox and navigate to the attacker's email with a green badge titled Urgent: Action Required - Suspicious Login Attempt Detected:

- Using the same payload will not work because the server has correctly implemented a secure and unpredictable CSRF token that won't allow requests from an unknown source.

## samesite cookie bypass

Overview

Let's dive into a crucial defence mechanism known as SameSite cookies. These cookies come with a special attribute designed to control when they are sent along with cross-site requests. Implementing the SameSite cookie property is a reliable safeguard against cross-origin data leaks, CSRF, and XSS attacks. Depending on the request's context, it tells the browser when to transmit the cookie. **Strict**, **Lax**, and **None** are the three potential values for the attribute.  

The most substantial level of protection is offered by setting it to strict, which guarantees that the cookie is only sent if the request comes from the same origin as the cookie. Specific cross-site usage is permitted by lax, such as top-level navigations, which are less likely to raise red flags. None of them need the secure attribute, and all requests made by websites that belong to third parties will send cookies.

Different Types of SameSite Cookies!

- **Lax**: Lax SameSite cookies are like a friendly neighbour. They provide a moderate level of protection by allowing cookies to be sent in top-level navigations and safe HTTP methods like GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS. This means that cookies will not be sent with cross-origin POST requests, helping to mitigate certain types of CSRF attacks. However, cookies are still included in GET requests initiated by external websites, which may pose a security risk if sensitive information is stored in cookies.
- **Strict**: Strict SameSite cookies act as vigilant guards. They offer the highest level of protection by restricting cookies to be sent only in a first-party context. This means that cookies are only sent with requests originating from the same site that set the cookie, effectively preventing cross-site request forgery attacks. By enforcing strict isolation between different origins, strict SameSite cookies significantly enhance the security of web applications, especially in scenarios where sensitive user data is involved.
- **None**: None SameSite cookies behave like carefree globetrotters. They are sent with both first-party and cross-site requests, making them convenient for scenarios where cookies need to be accessible across different origins. However, to prevent potential security risks associated with cross-site requests, None SameSite cookies require the **Secure** attribute if the request is made over HTTPS. This ensures that cookies are only transmitted over secure connections, reducing the likelihood of interception or tampering by malicious actors during transit.

The Lax Exploit Adventure

- Now that the attacker can access Josh's bank account, his main objective is to log him out of his current account so that he cannot make any further bank transactions.
- He noticed a logout cookie that is set once he logs in, and this cookie is set as **Lax**, which means that this will be sent in all top-level navigations and safe HTTP requests like GET.
- Here is the server-side code that validates the cookie and checks its value; based on the value, the code logs out the user.

```php
<?php
$cookieNames = array_keys($_COOKIE);
if($_COOKIE["logout"] == "xxxxxxx"){
	// Loop through each cookie and delete it
foreach ($cookieNames as $cookieName) {
// If it's desired to kill the session, also delete the session cookie.
session_destroy();
..
...
}
```

- The script requires a cookie value, but this entirely depends upon the type of SameSite value. Since the type is Lax, it won't be forwarded to cross-site requests other than top-level navigation and GET requests.
- To log Josh out of his bank account, the attacker can send another email to him, masquerading as a bank representative and persuading him to participate in a survey to win a prize.

- Navigate to `mailbox.thm:8081`, and open the mail with a red flag titled "**Exclusive Opportunity: Complete Our Survey for a Chance to Win a Ferrari!**".
- - You will see that the logout CSRF payload is crafted using the following payload:
```html
<a href="https://mybank.thm:8080/logout.php" target="_blank">Survey Link!</a>
```

- The attacker must make a simple GET request to `logout.php`; since the cookie is set as Lax, it will be forwarded to the page.  
- As the request is coming from a verified source and the logout cookie is also set, Josh will be logged out of the bank website with no way to [josh crying on the side] log in again (as the password was changed in the previous task).

What was the missing link?

- The developer of MyBank LLC did not consider the SameSite attribute for cookies while writing the code. The attack would have been avoided if the SameSite attribute had been set to **Strict** instead of **Lax**.  If the attribute had been Strict, the cookie wouldn't have been passed during the cross-site request.
- Moreover, as a pentester/red teamer, it's essential to analyse each attribute of the cookie set by a domain. Most of the time, small mistakes by coders open avenues of exploitation in an apparently secure web application.

Lax with POST Scenario - Chaining the Exploit

As a pentester, it is important to check the cookies being set by the website. As the cookie set in the last example was Lax, it was possible to logout any user. But the above scenario is possible only with GET requests, and nothing can be done in case of POST requests.

Initially, when the SameSite attribute was introduced to increase web security by restricting how cookies are sent in cross-site requests, Google Chrome and other browsers did not enforce a default behaviour for cookies without a specified SameSite attribute. This meant developers had to explicitly set `SameSite=None` to allow cookies to be sent in cross-site requests, such as in iframes or third-party content. However, Chrome changed its default behaviour to enhance security and privacy further and better protect against CSRF attacks. If a SameSite attribute is not specified for a cookie, Chrome automatically treats it as `SameSite=Lax`. This default setting allows cookies to be sent in a first-party context and with top-level navigation GET requests but not in third-party or cross-site requests, thereby balancing usability with increased security measures.  

But what if we want to make a POST request? Can we do something? The answer is **Yes**. As per the official documentation by [Chrome](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592):

_"Chrome will make an exception for cookies set without a SameSite attribute less than **2 minute**s ago. Such cookies will also be sent with non-idempotent (e.g. POST) top-level cross-site requests despite normal SameSite=Lax cookies requiring top-level cross-site requests to have a safe (e.g. GET) HTTP method."_

So, any cookie that is not set with SameSite attribute and if the server reads or modifies the cookie will be sent in cross-site request till **2 minutes** just like `SameSite=None`; after **2 minutes**, it will be treated as Lax by the browser. We will see how we can exploit this in the following example.

After reviewing the code, we can see that there is an `isBanned` cookie that is set after logging in. The value of the cookie determines if the user is banned or not and displays him a message if he is banned. Our objective is to change the value of the cookie once the user clicks on the malicious link. Here is the server-side code that performs the validation:


```php
if (!isset($_COOKIE['isBanned'])) { echo('&#60;script&#62;alert("isBanned cookie not found in request");&#60;/script&#62;'); 	exit(); }
if (isset($_POST['isBanned'])) {
	$status=$_POST['isBanned'];
     echo('<script>document.cookie="isBanned='.$status.'";</script>'); 
}
```

- There is a POST API call to `index.php` that accepts a parameter `isBanned` and sets the cookie's value. However, the server-side script expects the cookie (isBanned) to avoid any CSRF attack.
- If there is a cross-site request to the page, we cannot execute the script to create the cookie directly, as there won't be an `isBanned` cookie in our request.
- Let's try this. Log in again to the bank app using the username `GB82MYBANK5699` and password `GB82MYBANK5697`. As we log in, the script will update the value of `isBanned` cookie, so we need to wait for **2 minutes** here, otherwise, it will be forwarded till 2 minutes window.
- After **2 minutes**, open the mail titled Test Scenario - LAX+POST.

- The email consists of two learning buttons; the first will make a POST request to `index.php` to update the `isBanned` cookie value.
- The first button uses the following code:

```javascript
<script>
function launchAttack(){ setTimeout(function(){bank.submit()},1000)
}
</script>
<form style="display:none" name="bank" 
method=post action="http://mybank.thm:8080/index.php">
<input name="isBanned" value="true">
<input type="submit">
</form>
```

- This is because the `isBanned` cookie was not forwarded by the browser during the request.  
- So, what is the solution here? We can exploit the Chrome feature that sends the cookies in each web request if modified in the last **2 minutes**. As a pentester, it is essential to understand each web request and response. The `isBanned` cookie value is updated in two instances, once during login and the other during logout.
- We can chain the process to make the user visit the logout link; once he is logged out and the `isBanned` cookie is updated, we have a 2-minute window to call `index.php` to update the isBanned cookie value.
- Here is the code that will take the user to the logout page and then make a call to `index.php` with the updated `isBanned` cookie value.
- 

```javascript
<script>
function launchAttackSuccess(){
let win = window.open("http://mybank.thm:8080/logout.php",'');
setTimeout(function(){win.close();bank.submit()},1000)
}
</script>
<form style="display:none" name="bank" 
method=post action="http://mybank.thm:8080/index.php">
<input name="isBanned" value="true">
<input type="submit">
</form> 
```
- Click on the `Successful Attack` button, which will first log out the user, then make a POST request to `index.php`, and update the `isBanned` cookie value. Chrome will forward the cookie in the request as it is updated in less than **2 minutes**.

## additional exploits 


﻿XMLHttpRequest Exploitation

In the context of an AJAX request, CSRF is like someone making your web browser unknowingly send a request to a website where you're logged in. It's as if someone tricked your browser into doing something on a trusted site without your awareness, potentially causing unintended actions or changes in your account. CSRF attacks can still succeed even when AJAX requests are subject to the [Same-Origin Policy (SOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy), which typically forbids cross-origin requests.


```javascript
<script>
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('POST', 'http://mybank.thm/updatepassword', true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest");
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
        xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
            if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) {
                alert("Action executed!");
            }
        };
        xhr.send('action=execute&parameter=value');
    </script>
```

The XMLHttpRequest in the above code is designed to submit form data to the server and include custom headers. The complete process of sending requests will be seamless as the requests are performed in Javascript using AJAX.



Same Origin Policy (SOP) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Bypass

[CORS and SOP](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/corsandsop) bypass to launch CSRF is like an attacker using a trick to make your web browser send requests to a different website than the one you're on. Under an appropriate CORS policy, certain requests could only be submitted by recognised origins. However, misconfigurations in CORS policies can allow attackers to circumvent these limitations if they rely on origins that the attacker can control or if credentials are included in cross-origin requests.

```php
<?php // Server-side code (PHP)
 header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); 
// Allow requests from any origin (vulnerable CORS configuration) .
..// code to update email address ?>
```

  
﻿This is a simple PHP server-side script that handles the POST request. It has a vulnerable CORS configuration (**Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ***), allowing requests from any origin, and thus is vulnerable to CSRF since it doesn't implement anti-CSRF measures. The usage of **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *** depends on the specific business use case and requirements. There are scenarios where allowing requests from different origins is necessary and legitimate, such as in public APIs or content distribution networks. However, it's crucial to carefully consider the security implications and ensure that **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials** is set accordingly to forward credentials only to trusted origins. It's important to note that **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *** and **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:true** cannot be used together due to security restrictions imposed by the [CORS specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol-and-credentials). You will learn various CORS bypass techniques in a separate room on THM.  

Referer Header Bypass

When making an HTTP request, the referer header contains the URL of the last page the user visited before making the current request. Some websites guard against CSRF by only allowing queries if the referer header matches their domain. The utility of this as a stand-alone CSRF protection solution is reduced when this header may be changed or eliminated, as happens with user-installed browser extensions, privacy tools, or meta tags that instruct the browser to omit the Referer.  

Now that we have an understanding of various exploitation techniques of CSRF. We will now discuss key mitigation measures to protect from the attack.

## defense mechanisms

CSRF plays a critical role for pentesters, allowing them to simulate attacks where users unwittingly execute unauthorised actions on trusted websites. By exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities, pentesters can assess the effectiveness of an application's defences against forged requests, identify potential security gaps in session management, and evaluate the robustness of implemented anti-CSRF measures. Following are some of the critical measures that are recommended for pentesters and secure coders.

Pentesters/Red Teamers

- **CSRF Testing**: Actively test applications for CSRF vulnerabilities by attempting to execute unauthorised actions through manipulated requests and assess the effectiveness of implemented protections. 
- **Boundary Validation**: Evaluate the application's validation mechanisms, ensuring that user inputs are appropriately validated and anti-CSRF tokens are present and correctly verified to prevent request forgery.
- **Security Headers Analysis**: Assess the presence and effectiveness of security headers, such as CORS and Referer, to enhance the overall security and prevent various attack vectors, including CSRF.
- **Session Management Testing**: Examine the application's session management mechanisms, ensuring that session tokens are securely generated, transmitted, and validated to prevent unauthorised access and actions.
- **CSRF Exploitation Scenarios**: Explore various CSRF exploitation scenarios, such as embedding malicious requests in image tags or exploiting trusted endpoints, to identify potential weaknesses in the application's defences and improve security measures.


Secure Coders

- **Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Integrate anti-CSRF tokens into each form or request to ensure that only requests with valid and unpredictable tokens are accepted, thwarting CSRF attacks. 
- **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: Set the SameSite attribute on cookies to '**Strict**' or '**Lax**' to control when cookies are sent with cross-site requests, minimising the risk of CSRF by restricting cookie behaviour.
- **Referrer Policy**: Implement a strict referrer policy, limiting the information disclosed in the referer header and ensuring that requests come from trusted sources, thereby preventing unauthorised cross-site requests.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Utilise CSP to define and enforce a policy that specifies the trusted sources of content, mitigating the risk of injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Double-Submit Cookie Pattern**: Implement a secure double-submit cookie pattern, where an anti-CSRF token is stored both in a cookie and as a request parameter. The server then compares both values to authenticate requests.
- **Implement CAPTCHAS**: Secure developers can incorporate CAPTCHA challenges as an additional layer of defense against CSRF attacks especially in user authentication, form submissions, and account creation processes.
