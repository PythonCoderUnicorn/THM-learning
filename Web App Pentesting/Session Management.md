In this room, you will learn about Session Management. Thinking about your interactions with web applications, you should realise that you do not provide a web application with your username and password on every request. Instead, after authentication, you are provided with a session. This session is used by the web application to keep your state, track your actions, and decide whether or not you are allowed to do what you are trying to do. Session management aims to ensure that these steps are performed correctly. Otherwise, it may be possible for a threat actor to compromise your session and effectively hijack it!

the HTTP protocol is inherently stateless. Sessions are, therefore, used to track users throughout their use of a web application. Session management is the process of managing these sessions and ensuring that they remain secure.

session creation > session tracking > session timeout > session termination

**Session Creation**

You might think this first step in the lifecycle occurs only after you provide your credentials, such as a username and password. However, on many web applications, the initial session is already created when you visit the application. This is because some applications want to track your actions even before authentication. However, our main focus for this room will be on authenticated sessions. Once you provide your username and password, you receive a session value that is then sent with each new request. How these session values are generated, used, and stored is crucial in securing session creation.

**Session Expiry**

Because the HTTP protocol is stateless, it may happen that a user of the web application all of a sudden stops using it. For example, you might close the tab or your entire browser. Since the protocol is stateless, the web application has no method to know that this action has occurred. This is where session expiry comes into play. Your session value itself should have a lifetime attached to it. If the lifetime expires and you submit an old session value to the web application, it should be denied as the session should have been expired. Instead, you should be redirected to the login page to authenticate again and start the session management lifecycle all over again!

**Session Termination**

However, in some cases, the user might forcibly perform a logout action. In the event that this occurs, the web application should terminate the user's session. While this is similar to session expiry, it is unique in the sense that even if the session's lifetime is still valid, the session itself should be terminated. Issues in this termination process could allow a threat actor to gain persistent access to an account.  

In this room, we will look at what can go wrong in each of these session states. We want to ensure that session security encapsulates the entire lifecycle. However, we first need to cover a bit more theory.


## authentication vs authorization

```
[identification] username
[authentication] password
[authorization]  data
[accountability]
```


Identification

Identification is the process of verifying who the user is. This starts with the user claiming to be a specific identity. In most web applications, this is performed by submitting your username. You are claiming that you are the person associated with the specific username. Some applications use uniquely created usernames, whereas others will take your email address as the username.  

Authentication

Authentication is the process of ensuring that the user is who they say they are. Where in identification, you provide a username, for authentication, you provide proof that you are who you say you are. For example, you can supply the password associated with the claimed username. The web application can confirm this information if it is valid; this is the point where session creation would kick in.  

Authorisation

Authorisation is the process of ensuring that the specific user has the rights required to perform the action requested. For example, while all users may view data, only a select few may modify it. In the session management lifecycle, session tracking plays a critical role in authorisation.  

Accountability

Accountability is the process of creating a record of the actions performed by users. We should track the user's session and log all actions performed using the specific session. This information plays a critical role in the event of a security incident to piece together what has happened.  

IAAA and Session Management

Now that you understand the differences between authentication and authorisation let's bring this back to session management. Authentication plays a role in how sessions are created. Authorisation becomes important to verify that the user associated with a specific session has the permission to perform the action they are requesting. Accountability is crucial for us to piece together what actually occurred in an incident, which means it is important that requests are logged and that the session associated with each request is also logged.


## cookies vs tokens


Cookie-Based Session Management

Cookie-based session management is often called the old-school way of managing sessions. Once the web application wants to begin tracking, in a response, the Set-Cookie header value will be sent. Your browser will interpret this header to store a new cookie value. Let's take a look at such a Set-Cookie header:

`Set-Cookie: session=12345;`

Your browser will create a cookie entry for a cookie named `session` with a value of `12345` which will be valid for the domain where the cookie was received from. Several attributes can also be added to this header. If you want to learn more about all of them, please refer [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie), but some of the noteworthy ones are:

- **Secure** - Indicates to the browser that the cookie may only be transmitted over verified HTTPS channels. If there are certificate errors or HTTP is used, the cookie value will not be transmitted.
- **HTTPOnly** - Indicates to the browser that the cookie value may not be read by client-side JavaScript.
- **Expire** - Indicates to the browser when a cookie value will no longer be valid and should be removed.
- **SameSite** - Indicates to the browser whether the cookie may be transmitted in cross-site requests to help protect against CSRF attacks.

A key thing to remember with cookie-based authentication is that the browser itself will decide when a certain cookie value will be sent with a request. After reviewing the domain and the attributes of the cookie, the browser makes this decision, and the cookie is attached automatically without any additional client-side JavaScript code.


Token-Based Session Management

Token-based session management is a relatively new concept. Instead of using the browser's automatic cookie management features, it relies on client-side code for the process. After authentication, the web application provides a token within the request body. Using client-side JavaScript code, this token is then stored in the browser's LocalStorage.

When a new request is made, JavaScript code must load the token from storage and attach it as a header. One of the most common types of tokens is JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are passed through the `Authorization: Bearer` header. However, as we are not using the browser's built-in cookie management features, it is a bit of the wild west where anything goes. Although there are standards, nothing is really forcing anything from sticking to these standards.

## session lifecycle

**Weak Session Values**

It is less common to see weak session values in modern times as frameworks are consistently used. However, with the rise of LLMs and other AI code-assistant solutions, you would be surprised at how often these old-school vulnerabilities are creeping back in.

If a custom session creation mechanism has been implemented, there is a good chance that the session values may be guessable. A good example of this is a mechanism that simply base64 encodes the username as the session value. If a threat actor can reverse engineer the session creation process, they can generate or guess session values to hijack the accounts of legitimate users.

**Controllable Session Values**

In certain tokens, such as JWTs, all the relevant information to both create and verify the JWT's validity is provided. If security measures are not enforced, such as verifying the token's signature or ensuring that the signature itself was created securely, a threat actor would be able to generate their own token. These types of attacks will be discussed in more detail in a future room.

**Session Fixation**

Remember the web application that already gave you a session before authentication? These web applications can be vulnerable to something called session fixation. If your session value is not adequately rotated once you authenticate, a suitably positioned threat actor could record it when you are still unauthenticated and wait for you to authenticate to gain access to your session.

**Insecure Session Transmission**

In modern environments, it is common for the authentication server and the application servers to be distinct. Think about things like Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. One application is used for authentication to several other web applications. In order for this process to work, your session material must be transferred from the authentication server to the application server via your browser. In this transmission, however, certain issues can creep in that would expose your session information to a threat actor. The most common is an insecure redirect where the threat actor can control the URL where you will be redirected to post-authentication. This could allow the threat actor to hijack your session.

### session tracking

**Authorisation Bypass**

Authorisation bypasses occur when there aren't sufficient checks being performed on whether a user is allowed to perform the action they requested. In essence, this fails to track the user's session and its associated rights correctly. It is also worth talking about the two types of authorisation bypasses:

- Vertical bypass - You can perform an action that is reserved for a more privileged user
- Horizontal bypass - You can perform an action you are allowed to perform, but on a dataset that you should not be allowed to perform the action on  

In most applications, vertical bypasses are easy to defend against since function decorators and path-based access control configurations are used. However, with horizontal bypasses, the user is performing an action that they should be allowed to perform. The issue is that they are performing it on someone else's data. To remedy this, actual code is required to verify who the user is (extracted from their session), which data they are requesting, and if they are allowed to request or modify the dataset.


**Insufficient Logging**

A key issue during incidents is not having sufficient information to piece together an attack. While a lot of logging will occur at an infrastructure level, application logging can be crucial to understanding what went wrong. In the event that the actions performed by a specific session and the ability to retrace that session to a user do not exist, it can leave gaps in the investigation that cannot be filled. It is also worth making sure that logs cover both accepted and rejected actions. In the event of a session hijacking attack, the actions would appear legitimate. Therefore, simply logging rejected actions is not sufficient to paint the picture.

Session Expiry

Session expiry only has a single vulnerability, which is when the expiry time for sessions are excessive. A session should be seen as a ticket to a movie. Each night, the same movie is shown, but we don't want someone to be able to use the same ticket to watch the movie again. The same counts for sessions, we need to make sure that our session expiry time takes into consideration our specific application's use case. A banking application should have a shorter session lifetime than your webmail client.

Furthermore, in the event of long-life sessions, such as those for a webmail client, the session itself should attest to the location where it is used. If this location changes (which could be an indication of session hijacking), the session should be terminated.

Session Termination

For session termination, the key issue is when sessions are not properly terminated server-side when the logout action is performed. Suppose a threat actor were to hijack a user's session. In that case, even if the user became aware of the issue, without the ability to invalidate the session server-side, there isn't a method for the user to flush the access of the threat actor. However, this can be quite an issue for tokens where the lifetime of the token is embedded in the token itself. In these cases, the token can be added to a blocklist to be verified against. Some applications also take this further where all the sessions of the user can be viewed and terminated. Furthermore, upon a successful password reset, it is also recommended that all sessions are terminated to allow a user to regain full control of their account.

inspect page > storage > cookies

http://10.10.44.40/auth/register
```

We first notice that we are not presented with any cookies or tokens when we first visit the page. This tells us that unauthenticated sessions are most likely not being tracked. If we click the Sign-Up button, we see that there are two main signups:

- Student - This can be used by anyone to create a profile
- Lecturer - Requires a verification code for the signup process

```
