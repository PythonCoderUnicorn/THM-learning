## task 4

Hashing

Hashing refers to taking any data input, such as a password and calculating its hash equivalent. The hash equivalent is a long string which cannot be reversed since the act of hashing is known as a one-way function.

```
echo -n 'mypassword123' | md5sum

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt

secret123


ssh sarah@10.10.196.87
rainbowtree1230x


What is the hash type stored in the file hashA.txt

find . -type f -name hashA.txt
~/system AB/server_mail/server settings/

cat hashA.txt copy and paste in new tab nano hashA.txt

md4

What is the hash type stored in the file hashB.txt

find . -type f -name hashB.txt
./oldLogs/settings/craft/hashB.txt

cat hashB.txt copy and paste in nano hashB.txt

SHA-1


Find a wordlist  with the file extention of '.mnf' and use it to crack the hash with the filename hashC.txt. What is the password?

find . -type f -name *.mnf
ls |grep ww.mnf


scp 'sarah@10.10.196.97:/home/sarah/system\ AB/db/ww.mnf' ~/Desktop/

scp ww.mnf sarah@10.10.196.87:~/Desktop

## task 6

Encryption using GPG

Encryption refers to the process of concealing sensitive data by converting it to an unintelligible format. The only way to reverse the process is to use a key; this is known as decryption.

```
'secret data' => 'QFnvZbCSffGzrauFXx9icxsN9UHHuU+sCL0sGcUCPGKyRquc9ldAfFIpVI+m8mc/'
password: pass

nano secret.txt 

ENCRYPT = AES-256
gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 --symmetric secret.txt
password= pass

DECRYPT AES-256
gpg secret.txt.gpg 


  
You wish to encrypt a file called history_logs.txt using the AES-128 scheme. What is the full command to do this?

gpg --cipher-algo AES-128 --symmetric history_logs.txt

  
What is the command to decrypt the file you just encrypted?

gpg history_logs.txt.gpg


  
Find an encrypted file called layer4.txt, its password is bob. Use this to locate the flag. What is the flag?

find . -type f -name layer4.txt

gpg layer4.txt = bob => layer5.txt

Find a file called layer3.txt, its password is james.
find . -type f -name layer3.txt
./oldLogs/2014-02-15/layer3.txt
~/oldLogs/2014-02-15/

Find a file called layer2.txt, its password is tony.
find . -type f -name layer2.txt
cd ./oldLogs/settings/

## task 7

cracking encrypted gpg files

```
you have a gpg file but no password

in Kali/Parrot there is gpg2john
sudo gpg2john     (https://github.com/openwall/john)

gpg2john secret.txt.gpg > hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/woordlists/rockyou.txt --format=gpg hash


  
Find an encrypted file called personal.txt.gpg and find a wordlist called data.txt. Use tac to reverse the wordlist before brute-forcing it against the encrypted file. What is the password to the encrypted file?

find . -type f -name personal.txt.gpg
./oldLogs/units/personal.txt.gpg

find . -type f -name data.txt
./logs/zmn/old stuff/-mvLp/data.txt


scp 'sarah@10.10.196.87:/home/sarah/oldLogs/units/personal.txt.gpg' ~/Desktop/

## task 8

SQL 
SQL is a language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data from databases. Therefore, it is important to firmly grasp the concept of how to read data from databases in Linux

```
service mysql start | stop

CONNECT TO REMOTE SQL DATABASE
mysql -u <username> -p -h <host IP>

OPEN MYSQL FILE LOCALLY
mysql -u <username. -p <password>

source <filename>
source employees.sql

SHOW DATABASES;

USE <database name>;

SHOW TABLES; (of database)

DESCRIBE <database name>;

SELECT * FROM <table name>;
SELECT * FROM  employees;


  
Find a file called employees.sql and read the SQL database. (Sarah and Sameer can log both into mysql using the password: password). Find the flag contained in one of the tables. What is the flag?

mysql -u sarah -p      to sign in as sarah
password

hint= first name Lobel

describe employees;
select * from employees where first_name ='Lobel';

Flag{13490AB8}

```


## final 

```
  
Go to the /home/shared/chatlogs directory and read the first chat log named: LpnQ. Use this to help you to proceed to the next task.
