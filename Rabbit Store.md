# Erlang Port Mapper Daemon

Port 4369 is used for epmd (Erlang Port Mapper Daemon), which is a small daemon that runs alongside every RabbitMQ node and is used by the runtime to discover what port a particular node listens on for inter-node communication.


"rabbit" strongly suggests that RabbitMQ, a message broker, is in use.
