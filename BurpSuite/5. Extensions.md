### BurpSuite API

you have access to a wide range of API endpoints that allow you to create and integrate your modules with Burp Suite

The Extensions APIs give developers significant power and flexibility when writing custom extensions. You can use these APIs to seamlessly interact with Burp Suite's existing functionality and tailor your extensions to perform specific tasks.

1. Python (via Jython): If you prefer Python as your programming language, you can utilize Jython, which is a Java implementation of Python to create Burp Suite extensions.
2. Ruby (via JRuby): Developers familiar with Ruby can leverage JRuby, a Java implementation of Ruby, to build Burp Suite extensions.

It's important to note that coding your extensions for Burp Suite can be a complex task, and it goes beyond the scope of this module. However, suppose you are interested in exploring this area further and creating custom extensions. In that case, PortSwigger provides a comprehensive reference that is an excellent resource for developing Burp Suite extensions.
