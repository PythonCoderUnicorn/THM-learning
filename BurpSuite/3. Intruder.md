#BurpSuite 

Intruder is Burp Suite's built-in **fuzzing tool** that allows for automated request modification and repetitive testing with variations in input values.

captured request (often from the Proxy module)
Intruder can send multiple requests with slightly altered values based on user-defined configurations
- brute forcing login forms
- substituting username and password fields
- using wordlists for attacks
- rate limited on Community Edition

`CTRL + I` shortcut 

captured traffic > Send to Intruder 

`10.10.49.243`

4 tabs in Intruder
- Positions = attack type and configure where we ant to insert our payloads in request template
- Payloads = select values to insert into the positions defined , load a wordlist, match, replace or skip using RegEx
- Resource pool = not useful for Community Edition
- Settings = configure attack behaviour, how Burp handles results and the attack , can flag requests that has specific text or response to redirects

 Burp Suite automatically attempts to identify the most probable positions where payloads can be inserted. These positions are highlighted in green and enclosed by section marks (`§`)  

- The `Add §` button allows us to define new positions manually by highlighting them within the request editor and then clicking the button.
- The `Clear §` button removes all defined positions, providing a blank canvas where we can define our own positions.
- The `Auto §` button automatically attempts to identify the most likely positions based on the request. This feature is helpful if we previously cleared the default positions and want them back.

```
Payload positions
Host: x.x.x.x
...
username=pentester&password=expl0it

--- highlight the words > Add §

username=§pentest§&password=§expl0it§
```

now the fuzzing fun can begin


Payloads
- create, assign, configure payloads

Payload Sets
Payload settings
- simple list type can manually add/remove payloads to the Add text box
Payload processing
- define rules to be applied to each payload in the set sent to target
- ex: capitalize every word, skip payloads that match a RegEx pattern
Payload encoding
- default is url encoding to ensure safe transmission of payloads 

  
Which **Payload processing** rule could we use to add characters at the end of each payload in the set?
- add suffix

### SNIPER
- default attack type
- useful for password brute forcing / fuzzing API endpoints

```
POST /support/login HTTP/1.1
Host: x.x.x.x
...
username=§pentest§&password=§expl0it§

```

wordlist = `burp, suite, intruder` = 6 requests 
- `username | password = burp/suite/intruder`
- total number of requests = `number of words * number of positions`
- 3 parameters * 100 words = 300
- 1 set of payloads 

### Battering Ram

places same payload in every position at the same time rather than substituting each payload into each position
- same wordlist  `burp, suite, intruder`
- `username=burp&password=burp`
- `username=suite&password=suite`

### Pitchfork

uses 1 payload set per position (max of 20) and iterates through them all
- word list usernames = `joel, harriet, alex`
- word list passwords = `j03l, Emma1815, Sk1ll`

```
username=joel&password=J03l
username=harriet&password=Emma1815
username=alex&password=Sk1ll
```

useful for credential stuffing attacks that require separate payload sets

### Cluster bomb

multiple payload sets (1 per position, max 20)
iterates thru the payload set individually testing every combination 
- usernames = `joel, harriet, alex`
- passwords = `J03l, Emma1815, Sk1ll`

we don't know which password belongs to which user, Cluster bomb every combination = 9 requests
```
username=joel&password=J03l
username=joel&password=Emma1815
username=joel&password=Sk1ll
username=harriet&password=J03l
username=harriet&password=Emma1815 ...
```

with rate limits and size of payloads this can take a long time and create lots of traffic 

useful for credential brute-forcing scenarios where the mapping between usernames and passwords is unknown

The first set contains 100 lines, the second contains 2 lines, and the third contains 30 lines.
- 100x2x30 = 6000
