## file system

The file system used in modern versions of Windows is the **New Technology File System** or simply [NTFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/ntfs-overview).

Before NTFS, there was **FAT16/FAT32** (File Allocation Table) and **HPFS** (High Performance File System). 

You still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc. but traditionally not on personal Windows computers/laptops or Windows servers.

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

- Supports files larger than 4GB
- Set specific permissions on folders and files
- Folder and file compression
- Encryption ([Encryption File System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-encryption) or **EFS**)

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/backup-and-storage/fat-hpfs-and-ntfs-file-system

On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.

The permissions are:

- **Full control**
- **Modify**
- **Read & Execute**
- **List folder contents**
- **Read**
- **Write**

How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?

- Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
- From the context menu, select `Properties`.
- Within Properties, click on the `Security` tab.
- In the `Group or user names` list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.

Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).
Every file has at least one data stream (`$DATA`), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data

```
C:\Windows        holds the Windows OS

system ennviroment variables %windir%
system32 folder holds important files for the OS (caution)
```

## user accounts

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: **Administrator** & **Standard User**. 

The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system. 

- An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
- A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.

```
start menu > other user  |  system settings > other users
```

access user profile info use the Local User and Group Management
```
right clicl on Start Menu > Run > lusrmgr.msc
```

User Account Control (UAC) applies to regular users but not admin


## Task manager

The Task Manager provides information about the applications and processes currently running on the system. Other information is also available, such as how much CPU and RAM are being utilized, which falls under **Performance**.

shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + Esc
