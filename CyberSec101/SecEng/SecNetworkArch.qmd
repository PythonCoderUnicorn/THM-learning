# Secure Network Architecture

VLANs (Virtual LAN) are used to segment portions of a network at layer two and differentiate devices. 

VLANs are configured on a switch by adding a "tag" to a frame. The 802.1q or dot1q tag will designate the VLAN that the traffic originated from.

VLAN data frame
destination > source address > VLAN tag [TPID PRI CFI VID] > length/type > data > FCS

The 802.1 tag provides a standard between vendors that will always define the VLAN of a frame

switch: Open vSwitch  
default config: `ovs-vsctl show`
add VLAN tags: `ovs-vsctl set port <interface> tag= <0-99>`

```
Port eth1
  tag: 10
  interface eth1
```


tagging unknown traffic

native VLAn is for untagged traffic
need to know interface & tag
`ovs-vsctl set port eth0 tag10 vlan_mode= native-untagged`
