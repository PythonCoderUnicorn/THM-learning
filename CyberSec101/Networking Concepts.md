## OSI model 

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer


physical = physical connections , wires ,fibre cable

data link = protocol enables data transfer between nodes

Examples of layer 2 include Ethernet, i.e., 802.3, and WiFi, i.e., 802.11. Ethernet and WiFi addresses are six bytes. Their address is called a MAC address, where MAC stands for Media Access Control. They are usually expressed in hexadecimal format with a colon separating each two bytes. The three leftmost bytes identify the vendor.
```
ni = network interface 
ua = unique address of network interface
[ ni   ] [ ua.  ]
a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d
```
We expect to see two MAC addresses in each frame in real network communication over Ethernet or WiFi. The packet in the screenshot below shows:

- The destination data-link address (MAC address) highlighted in yellow
- The source data link address (MAC address) is highlighted in blue
- The remaining bits show the data being sent

network layer = sends data between 2 nodes on same network segment

transport layer = end 2 end communication between hosts (browsers, servers)  
- TCP transmission control protocol
- UDP user datagram protocol

session layer = establish , maintain, synch communication between apps running on different hosts
- NFS network file system 
- RPC remote procedure call

presentation layer = ensures data is delivered in a form the app layer understands
- data encoding, compression, encryption
- ASCII

application layer = network services, web browser  HTTP

## TCP/IP

In our presentation of the ISO OSI model, we went from bottom to top, from layer 1 to layer 7. In this task, let’s look at things from a different perspective, from top to bottom. From top to bottom, we have:

- **Application Layer**: The OSI model application, presentation and session layers, i.e., layers 5, 6, and 7, are grouped into the application layer in the TCP/IP model.
- **Transport Layer**: This is layer 4.
- **Internet Layer**: This is layer 3. The OSI model’s network layer is called the Internet layer in the TCP/IP model.
- **Link Layer**: This is layer 2.

Many modern networking textbooks show the TCP/IP model as five layers instead of four. For example, in Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach 8th Edition, [Kurose and Ross](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.php) describe the following five-layer Internet protocol stack by including the physical layer:

- Application
- Transport
- Network
- Link
- Physical

In the following tasks, we will cover the IP protocol from the Internet layer and the UDP and TCP protocols from the transport layer.

## IP addresses and subnets

When you hear the word IP address, you might think of an address like `192.168.0.1` or something less common, such as `172.16.159.243`. In both cases, you are right. Both of these are IP addresses; IPv4 (IP version 4) addresses to be specific.

Every host on the network needs a unique identifier for other hosts to communicate with him. Without a unique identifier, the host cannot be found without ambiguity. When using the TCP/IP protocol suite, we need to assign an IP address for each device connected to the network.

One analogy of an IP address is your home postal address. Your postal address allows you to receive letters and parcels from all over the world. Furthermore, it can identify your home without ambiguity; otherwise, you cannot shop online!

As you might already know, we have IPv4 and IPv6 (IP version 6). IPv4 is still the most common, and whenever you come across a text mentioning IP without the version, we expect them to mean IPv4.

So, what makes an IP address? An IP address comprises four octets, i.e., 32 bits. Being 8 bits, an octet allows us to represent a decimal number between 0 and 255. An IP address is shown in the image below.

```
octet 1 (0-255 | octet 2 | octet 3  | octet 4
192               168       1           1       = 192.168.1.1
```


You can look up your IP address on the MS Windows command line using the command `ipconfig`. On Linux and UNIX-based systems, you can issue the command `ifconfig` or `ip address show`, which can be typed as `ip a s`. In the terminal window below, we show `ifconfig`.

terminal output above indicates the following:

- The host (laptop) IP address is `192.168.66.89`
- The subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`
- The broadcast address is `192.168.66.255`

terminal output above indicates the following:

- The host (laptop) IP address is `192.168.66.89/24`
- The broadcast address is `192.168.66.255`

If you are wondering, a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` can also be written as `/24`. The `/24` means that the leftmost 24 bits within the IP address do not change across the network, i.e., the subnet. In other words, the leftmost three octets are the same across the whole subnet; therefore, we can expect to find addresses that range from `192.168.66.1` to `192.168.66.254`. Similar to what was mentioned earlier, `192.168.66.0` and `192.168.66.255` are the network and broadcast addresses, respectively.



### Private Addresses

As we are explaining IP addresses, it is useful to mention that for most practical purposes, there are two types of IP addresses:

- Public IP addresses
- Private IP addresses

RFC 1918 defines the following three ranges of private IP addresses:

- `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (`10/8`)
- `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (`172.16/12`)
- `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (`192.168/16`)

### Routing

A router is like your local post office; you hand them the mail parcel, and they would know how to deliver it. If we dig deeper, you might mail something to an address in another city or country. The post office will check the address and decide where to send it next.

```
Which of the following IP addresses is not a private IP address?

- 192.168.250.125
- 10.20.141.132
- 49.69.147.197   <<
- 172.23.182.251

Which of the following IP addresses is not a valid IP address?

- 192.168.250.15
- 192.168.254.17
- 192.168.305.19 <<
- 192.168.199.13


```


## UDP and TCP

The IP protocol allows us to reach a destination host on the network; the host is identified by its IP address. We need protocols that would enable processes on networked hosts to communicate with each other. There are two transport protocols to achieve that: UDP and TCP.

### UDP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) allows us to reach a specific process on this target host. UDP is a simple connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer, i.e., layer 4. Being connectionless means that it does not need to establish a connection. UDP does not even provide a mechanism to know that the packet has been delivered.

An IP address identifies the host; we need a mechanism to determine the sending and receiving process. This can be achieved by using port numbers. A port number uses two octets; consequently, it ranges between 1 and 65535; port 0 is reserved. (The number 65535 is calculated by the expression 216 − 1.)

A real-life example similar to UDP is the standard mail service, with no delivery confirmation. In other words, there is no guarantee that the UDP packet has been received successfully, similar to the case of sending a parcel using standard mail with no confirmation of delivery. In the case of standard mail, it means a cheaper cost than the mail delivery options with confirmation. In the case of UDP, it means better speed than a transport protocol that provides “confirmation.”

But what if we want a transport protocol that acknowledges received packets? The answer lies in using TCP instead of UDP.

### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses various mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery sent by the different processes on the networked hosts. Like UDP, it is a layer 4 protocol. Being connection-oriented, it requires the establishment of a TCP connection before any data can be sent.

In TCP, each data octet has a sequence number; this makes it easy for the receiver to identify lost or duplicated packets. The receiver, on the other hand, acknowledges the reception of data with an acknowledgement number specifying the last received octet.

A TCP connection is established using what’s called a three-way handshake. Two flags are used: SYN (Synchronise) and ACK (Acknowledgment). The packets are sent as follows:

1. SYN Packet: The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains the client’s randomly chosen initial sequence number.
2. SYN-ACK Packet: The server responds to the SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet, which adds the initial sequence number randomly chosen by the server.
3. ACK Packet: The three-way handshake is completed as the client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the reception of the SYN-ACK packet

Similar to UDP, TCP identifies the process of initiating or waiting (listening) for a connection using port numbers. As stated, a valid port number ranges between 1 and 65535 because it uses two octets and port 0 is reserved.

```
Which protocol requires a three-way handshake?
tcp

What is the approximate number of port numbers (in thousands)?
65
```



## encapsulation

Before wrapping up, it is crucial to explain another key concept: **encapsulation**. In this context, encapsulation refers to the process of every layer adding a header (and sometimes a trailer) to the received unit of data and sending the “encapsulated” unit to the layer below.

Encapsulation is an essential concept as it allows each layer to focus on its intended function. In the image below, we have the following four steps:

- **Application data**: It all starts when the user inputs the data they want to send into the application. For example, you write an email or an instant message and hit the send button. The application formats this data and starts sending it according to the application protocol used, using the layer below it, the transport layer.
- **Transport protocol segment or datagram**: The transport layer, such as TCP or UDP, adds the proper header information and creates the TCP **segment** (or UDP **datagram**). This segment is sent to the layer below it, the network layer.
- **Network packet**: The network layer, i.e. the Internet layer, adds an IP header to the received TCP segment or UDP datagram. Then, this IP **packet** is sent to the layer below it, the data link layer.
- **Data link frame**: The Ethernet or WiFi receives the IP packet and adds the proper header and trailer, creating a **frame**.

We start with application data. At the transport layer, we add a TCP or UDP header to create a **TCP segment** or **UDP datagram**. Again, at the network layer, we add the proper IP header to get an **IP packet** that can be routed over the Internet. Finally, we add the appropriate header and trailer to get a WiFi or Ethernet frame at the link layer.

### The Life of a Packet

Based on what we have studied so far, we can explain a _simplified version_ of the packet’s life. Let’s consider the scenario where you search for a room on TryHackMe.

1. On the TryHackMe search page, you enter your search query and hit enter.
2. Your web browser, using HTTPS, prepares an HTTP request and pushes it to the layer below it, the transport layer.
3. The TCP layer needs to establish a connection via a three-way handshake between your browser and the TryHackMe web server. After establishing the TCP connection, it can send the HTTP request containing the search query. Each TCP segment created is sent to the layer below it, the Internet layer.
4. The IP layer adds the source IP address, i.e., your computer, and the destination IP address, i.e., the IP address of the TryHackMe web server. For this packet to reach the router, your laptop delivers it to the layer below it, the link layer.
5. Depending on the protocol, The link layer adds the proper link layer header and trailer, and the packet is sent to the router.
6. The router removes the link layer header and trailer, inspects the IP destination, among other fields, and routes the packet to the proper link. Each router repeats this process until it reaches the router of the target server.

The steps will then be reversed as the packet reaches the router of the destination network. As we cover additional protocols, we will revisit this exercise and create a more in-depth version.

## telnet 

Start the AttackBox by pressing the **Start AttackBox** button at the top of this page. The AttackBox machine will start in Split-Screen view. If it is not visible, use the blue **Show Split View** button at the top of the page.

Give them about 2 minutes each to properly boot up. Once the two machines are ready, we need to start the terminal on the AttackBox to experiment with `telnet`.

The TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol is a network protocol for remote terminal connection. In simpler words, `telnet`, a TELNET client, allows you to connect to and communicate with a remote system and issue text commands. Although initially it was used for remote administration, we can use `telnet` to connect to any server listening on a TCP port number.

On the target virtual machine, different services are running. We will experiment with three of them:

- Echo server: This server echoes everything you send it. By default, it listens on port 7.
- Daytime server: This server listens on port 13 by default and replies with the current day and time.
- Web (HTTP) server: This server listens on TCP port 80 by default and serves web pages.

Before continuing, we should mention that the echo and daytime servers are considered security risks and should not be run; however, we started them explicitly to demonstrate communication with the server using `telnet`. In the terminal below, we connect to the target VM at the echo server’s TCP port number 7. To close the connection, press the `CTRL` + `]` keys simultaneously.

```
