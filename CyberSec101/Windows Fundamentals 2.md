computer management 
**Computer Management** (`compmgmt`) utility has three primary sections: System Tools, Storage, and Services and Applications.

**System Tools**

Let's start with **Task Scheduler**. Per Microsoft, with Task Scheduler, we can create and manage common tasks that our computer will carry out automatically at the times we specify.

A task can run an application, a script, etc., and tasks can be configured to run at any point. A task can run at log in or at log off. Tasks can also be configured to run on a specific schedule, for example, every five mins.

**Event Viewer**.

Event Viewer allows us to view events that have occurred on the computer. These records of events can be seen as an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the computer system. This information is often used to diagnose problems and investigate actions executed on the system.

Event Viewer has three panes.
1. The pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers. (as shown in the image above)
2. The pane in the middle will display a general overview and summary of the events specific to a selected provider.
3. The pane on the right is the actions pane.

5 event types in event logging
- error
- warning
- information
- success audit
- failure audit

event logs 
- application log
- security log
- system log
- customlog

**Shared Folders** 

where you will see a complete list of shares and folders shared that others can connect to.
under Shares, are the default share of Windows, `C$`, and default remote administration shares created by Windows, such as `ADMIN$`.

**Sessions**, you will see a list of users who are currently connected to the shares.

**Performance**, you'll see a utility called **Performance Monitor** (`perfmon`)

**Device Manager** allows us to view and configure the hardware, such as disabling any hardware attached to the computer.

Under Storage is **Windows Server Backup** and **Disk Management**.

Disk Management is a system utility in Windows that enables you to perform advanced storage tasks.  Some tasks are:

- Set up a new drive
- Extend a partition
- Shrink a partition
- Assign or change a drive letter (ex. E:)

**Windows Management Instrumentation** (WMI) service.
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems

**Windows Registry** (per Microsoft) is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.

The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:

- Profiles for each user
- Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
- Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
- What hardware exists on the system
- The ports that are being used.

**Warning**: The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations.
