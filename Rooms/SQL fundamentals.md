### Different Types of Databases

Now it makes sense that something is used by so many and for (relatively) so long that there would be multiple types of implementations. There are quite a few different types of databases that can be built, but for this introductory room, we are going to focus on the two primary types: **relational databases** (aka SQL) vs **non-relational databases** (aka NoSQL).

**Relational databases:** Store structured data, meaning the data inserted into this database follows a structure. For example, the data collected on a user consists of first_name, last_name, email_address, username and password. When a new user joins, an entry is made in the database following this structure. This structured data is stored in rows and columns in a table (all of which will be covered shortly); relationships can then be made between two or more tables (for example, user and order_history), hence the term relational databases.

**Non-relational databases:** Instead of storing data the above way, store data in a non-tabular format. For example, if documents are being scanned, which can contain varying types and quantities of data, and are stored in a database that calls for a non-tabular format. Here is an example of what that might look like:

```bash
 {
    _id: ObjectId("4556712cd2b2397ce1b47661"),
    name: { first: "Thomas", last: "Anderson" },
    date_of_birth: new Date('Sep 2, 1964'),
    occupation: [ "The One"],
    steps_taken : NumberLong(4738947387743977493)
}
```
