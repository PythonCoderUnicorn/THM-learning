## sudo

sudo command allows certain users to execute a command as another user, according to settings in the /etc/sudoers file. By default, **sudo** requires that users authenticate themselves with a password of another user.

## chmod

The **chmod** command sets the permissions of files or directories.
- user
- group
- other
All of them can rather read, write or execute a file. Permission to do so can be granted using chmod.

0 stands for "no permission."
1 stands for "execute";
2 stands for "write";
4 stands for "read".

`chmod 777 file`
`chmod 600 id_rsa`

## echo

echo is the most fundamental command found in most operating systems. It used to prints text to standard output, for example, terminal. It is mostly used in bash scripts in order to display output directly to user's console.

`echo "$( [command] )"`

what command would you use to echo the word "Hackerman"?
- `echo "Hackerman" `

## xargs

**xargs** command builds and executes command lines from standard input. It allows you to run the same command on a large number of files.

xargs is often used with the find command, in order to easily interact with its input.

`find /tmp -name test -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f`

display files in the tmp directory and print them out and remove these files
- ` **** / ***** *.*** ***** * ****** * ***** /***/*** `
- `find /  -name *.bak -type f -print | xargs /bin/cat`


## hexeditor

Hexeditor is an awesome tool designed to read and modify hex of a file, this comes in handy especially when it comes to troubleshooting magic numbers for files such as JPG, WAV and any other types of files.
- `apt install ncurses-hexedit`

A few resources I use for tasks that involve analysing files and fixing the magic number I use the following resources:

## curl

The **curl** command transfers data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). It is designed to work without any user interaction, so could be ideally used in a shell script.

`curl http://www.ismycomputeron.com/`

-o to save the file under a different name
`curl -o loginpage.html https://tryhackme.com/login`

Or, you might be interested in fetching the headers silently?  
`curl -I -s https://tryhackme.com`

How would you grab the headers silently of` [https://tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)` but `grepping` only the HTTP status code?
- ` curl -I -s https://tryhackme.com | grep HTTP `

## wget

The **wget** command downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP connection a network.

` wget http://somewebsite.com/files/images.zip `

Adding a `-b` switch will allow us to run wget in the background and return the terminal to its initial state.  
`wget -b http://www.example.org/files/images.zip`

```
wget https://tryhackme.com/flag.txt

  
What command would you run to download recursively up to level 5 from https://tryhackme.com ?

wget -r -l 5 https://tryhackme.com
```

## tar

**tar** is a command that allows creating, maintain, modify, and extracts files that are archived in the tar format.

` tar -xf archive.tar` 
-x extract files
-f file name 

`tar -xf tarball.tar`
`head flag.txt`
` THM{C0FFE1337101} `

## gzip

**gzip** - a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. gzip-compressed files have .gz extension.

A gzip file can be decompressed using a simple `gzip -d file.gz` command, where -d stands for decompress.

What is the content of gzip.txt?
- `gzip -d gzip.txt.gz`
- `head gzip.txt`
- ` THM{0AFDECC951A} `

## 7zip

**7-Zip** is a free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to place groups of files within compressed containers known as "archives".

**7z** is as simple as the **gzip** or **tar** and you can use the following command:  
  
`7z x file.zip` to extract the file

This tool comes in handy as it works with a lot more file extensions than other tools. You name the archive extension and 7z should be the tool for you.

- `7z zip.7z`
- `head 7zip.txt`
- ` THM{526accdf94} `


## Binwalk

**binwalk** allows users to analyze and extract firmware images and helps in identifying code, files, and other information embedded in those, or inside another file, taking as an example steganography.

A simple command such as `binwalk file` allows us to perform a simple file scan and identify code information.

`binwalk -e file` allows us to extract files from firmware. This method is usually used in CTFs, where some important information can be hidden within the file.

`binwalk -Me` file does the same as`-e`, but recursively.

- `binwalk -Me binwalk.png`
- `head /home/chad/_binwalk.png.extracted/binwalk.txt`
- ` THM{af5548a12bc2de} `
