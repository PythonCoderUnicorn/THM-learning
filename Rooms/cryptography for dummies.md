There are two types of cryptography :

- Symmetric
- Asymmetric

Symmetric - 
Let's say Alice wants to send message to Bob, but she doesn't want to send the message in plain text because anyone can read it.
Alice has encryption
Bob has same encryption as Alice for decryption
- symmetric cryptography both users have the same key to encrypt and decrypt the messages

Asymmetric - 
The encryption key can be used only for encryption, not for decryption and vice versa. 

The encryption key is called **Public key** and the decryption key is called **Private key**.

If you are using symmetric cryptography and someone takes your key he can encrypt and decrypt messages that you send.

asymmetric cryptography he can't decrypt the messages you encrypted with the public key.

Only the holder of the Private key can decrypt them

Hashes are a long strings of letters and numbers generated by hashing algorithms.

important thing about hashes is that **they are not reversible**. There's no way to decrypt/decode a hash

use of hashes is for file identification and storing sensitive data, like passwords
