We have seen security guards outside shopping malls, banks, restaurants, and houses. These guards are placed at the entrances of these areas to keep a check on people coming in or going out. The purpose of maintaining this check is to ensure nobody sneaks in without being permitted. This guard acts as a wall between his area and the visitors.

A lot of incoming and outgoing traffic flows daily between our digital devices and the Internet they are connected to. What if somebody sneaks in between this massive traffic without getting caught? We would also need a security guard for our digital devices then, who can check the data coming in and going out of them. This security guard is what we call a **firewall**. A firewall is designed to inspect a network's or digital device’s incoming and outgoing traffic. The goal is the same as for the security guard sitting outside a building: not letting any unauthorized visitor enter a system or a network. You instruct the firewall by giving it rules to check against all the traffic. Anything that comes in or goes out of your device or network would face the firewall first. The firewall will allow or deny that traffic based on its maintained rules. Most firewalls today go beyond rule-based filtering and offer extra functionalities to protect your device or network from the outside world. We will discuss all these firewalls and perform practical lab demonstrations on a few.

## types of firewalls

Firewall deployment became common in networks after organizations discovered their ability to filter harmful traffic from their systems and networks. Several different types of firewalls were introduced afterward, each serving a unique purpose. It's also important to note that different types of firewalls work on different OSI model layers. Firewalls are categorized into many types.

```
stateless
stateful inspection
proxy firewalls
next generation firewall
```

### Stateless Firewall

This type of firewall operates on layer 3 and layer 4 of the OSI model and works solely by filtering the data based on predetermined rules without taking note of the state of the previous connections. This means it will match every packet with the rules regardless of whether it is part of a legitimate connection. It maintains no information on the state of the previous connections to make decisions for future packets. Due to this, these firewalls can process the packets quickly. However, they cannot apply complex policies to the data based on its relationship with the previous connections. Suppose the firewall denies a few packets from a single source based on its rules. Ideally, it should drop all the future packets from this source because the previous packets could not comply with the firewall’s rules. However, the firewall keeps forgetting this, and future packets from this source will be treated as new and matched by its rules again.

### Stateful Firewall

Unlike stateless firewalls, this type of firewall goes beyond filtering packets by predetermined rules. It also keeps track of previous connections and stores them in a state table. This adds another layer of security by inspecting the packets based on their history with connections. Stateful firewalls operate at layer 3 and layer 4 of the OSI model. Suppose the firewall accepts a few packets from a source address based on its rules. In that case, it will take note of this connection in its stated table and allow all the future packets for this connection to automatically get allowed without inspecting each of them. Similarly, the stateful firewalls take note of the connections for which they deny a few packets, and based upon this information, they deny all the subsequent packets coming from the same source.

### Proxy Firewall

The problem with previous firewalls was their inability to inspect the contents of a packet. Proxy firewalls, or application-level gateways, act as intermediaries between the private network and the Internet and operate on the OSI model’s layer 7. They inspect the content of all packets as well. The requests made by users in a network are forwarded by this proxy after inspection and masking them with their own IP address to provide anonymity for the internal IP addresses. Content filtering policies can be applied to these firewalls to allow/deny incoming and outgoing traffic based on their content.

### Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

This is the most advanced type of firewall that operates from layer 3 to layer 7 of the OSI model, offering deep packet inspection and other functionalities that enhance the security of incoming and outgoing network traffic. It has an intrusion prevention system that blocks malicious activities in real time. It offers heuristic analysis by analyzing the patterns of attacks and blocking them instantly before reaching the network. NGFWs have SSL/TLS decryption capabilities, which inspect the packets after decrypting them and correlate the data with the threat intelligence feeds to make efficient decisions.

The table below lists each firewall’s characteristics, which will help you choose the most suitable firewall for different use cases.

## rules in firewalls

A firewall gives you control over your network’s traffic. Although it filters the traffic based on its built-in rules, some customized rules can be defined for various networks. For example, there would be networks that want to deny all the SSH traffic coming into their network. However, your network would have a requirement to allow SSH traffic from a few specific IP addresses. The rules allow you to configure these customized settings for your network’s incoming and outgoing traffic.

The basic components of a firewall’s rule are described below:

- **Source address:** The machine’s IP address that would originate the traffic.
- **Destination address:** The machine’s IP address that would receive the data.
- **Port:** The port number for the traffic.
- **Protocol:** The protocol that would be used during the communication.
- **Action:** This defines the action that would be taken upon identifying any traffic of this particular nature.
- **Direction:** This field defines the rule’s applicability to incoming or outgoing traffic.

### Types of Actions

The component “Action” from a rule indicates the steps to take after a data packet falls under the category of the defined rule. Three main actions that can be applied to a rule are explained below.

### Allow

A rule’s “Allow” action indicates that the particular traffic defined inside the rule would be permitted.

For example, let’s create a rule with an action to allow all the outgoing traffic from our network for port 80 (used for HTTP traffic to the Internet).

```
Action	Source	        Destination	Protocol	Port	Direction
Allow	192.168.1.0/24	Any	         TCP	    80	    Outbound
```

##### Deny

A rule’s “Deny” action means that the traffic defined inside the rule would be blocked and not permitted. These rules are fundamental for the security team to deny specific traffic coming from malicious IP addresses and create more rules to reduce the threat surface of the network.

For example, let’s create a rule with an action to deny all the incoming traffic on port 22 (used for remotely connecting to a machine via SSH) of our critical server.

```
Action	Source	  Destination	   Protocol	Port	Direction
Deny	Any	      192.168.1.0/24	TCP	    80	    Outbound
```


##### Forward

The action “Forward” redirects traffic to a different network segment using the forwarding rules created on the firewalls. This applies to the firewalls that provide routing functionality and act as gateways between different network segments.

For example, let’s create a rule with an action to forward all the incoming traffic on port 80 (used for HTTP traffic) to the web server `192.168.1.8`.

```
Action	Source	  Destination	   Protocol	Port	Direction
Forward  ANy      192.168.1.8      TCP       80     Inbound
```

### Directionality of Rules

Firewalls have different categories of rules, each categorized based on the traffic directionality on which the rules are created. Let’s examine each of these directionalities.

```
cloud/internet  <<--->> | firewall |  <=====> server/router
```

##### Inbound Rules

Rules are categorized as inbound rules when they are meant to be applied to incoming traffic only. For example, you might allow incoming HTTP traffic (port 80) on your web server.

##### Outbound Rules

These rules are made for outgoing traffic only. For example, blocking all outgoing SMTP traffic (port 25) from all the devices except the mail server.

##### Forward Rules

Forwarding rules are created to forward specific traffic inside the network. For example, a forwarding rule can be created to forward the incoming HTTP (port 80) traffic to the web server located in your network.


## linux iptables firewall

In the previous task, we discussed the built-in firewall available in the Windows OS. What if you are a Linux user? You still need control over your network traffic. Linux also offers the functionality of a built-in firewall. We have multiple firewall options available here. Let’s briefly review most of them and explore one of them in detail.

### Netfilter

Netfilter is the framework inside the Linux OS with core firewall functionalities, including packet filtering, NAT, and connection tracking. This framework serves as the foundation for various firewall utilities available in Linux to control network traffic. Some common firewall utilities that utilize this framework are listed below:

- **iptables:** This is the most widely used utility in many Linux distributions. It uses the Netfilter framework that provides various functionalities to control network traffic.
- **nftables:** It is a successor to the “iptables” utility, with enhanced packet filtering and NAT capabilities. It is also based on the Netfilter framework.
- **firewalld:** This utility also operates on the Netfilter framework and has predefined rule sets. It works differently from the others and comes with different pre-built network zone configurations.

### ufw 

ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), as the name says, eliminates the complications of making rules in a complex syntax in “iptables”(or its successor) by giving you an easier interface. It is more beginner-friendly. Basically, whatever rules you need in “iptables”, you can define them with some easy commands via ufw, which would then be configuring your desired rules in “iptables”. Let’s have a look at some basic ufw commands down below.

To check the status of the firewall, you could use the command below:
```
sudo ufw status

sudo ufw enable
```

Below is a rule created to allow all the outgoing connections from a Linux machine. The `default` in the command means that we are defining this policy as a default policy allowing all the outgoing traffic unless we define an outgoing traffic restriction on any specific application in a separate rule. You can also make a rule to allow/deny traffic coming into your machine by replacing `outgoing` with `incoming`  in the following command:

```
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

You can deny incoming traffic at any port in your system. Let's say that we want to block incoming SSH traffic. We can achieve this with the command `ufw deny 22/tcp`. As you can see, we first specified the action, `deny` in this case; furthermore, we specified the port and the transport protocol, which is TCP port 22, or simply `22/tcp`.

```
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp
```

To list down all the active rules in a numbered order, you can use the following command:
```
sudo ufw status numbered
```

To delete any rule, execute the following command with the rule number to delete:

```
sudo ufw delete 2
```
