INSPECTING THE SITE

It's very common for developers to leave comments about how the application works on the web page's source. Sometimes this information can include usernames, passwords and even hidden pages that users are not supposed to have access to. Look at page source, so through the source and identify the comments

`http://10.10.88.12:80` BFF social network page
comments show `/test-admin` exists

default credentials `admin:admin` `admin:password` `administrator:password123`
