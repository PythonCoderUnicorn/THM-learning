## SSH 

The in-browser functionality was used in [Linux Fundamentals Part 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1) to get you directly connected to your first ever Linux machine without any hassle.

In fact, the in-browser functionality uses the exact same protocol that we are going to be using today. This protocol is called **S**ecure **S**hell or **SSH** for short and is the common means of connecting to and interacting with the command line of a remote Linux machine.

We will be deploying two machines in this room:

- Your Linux machine
- The TryHackMe AttackBox

What is SSH & how Does it Work?

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network -- where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine

You can learn about the various types of encryption on a TryHackMe room. But for now, we only need to understand that:  

- SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
- Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet

The IP address displayed is the address of your Linux machine that you will be logging into using SSH. Take note of this for now.

Deploying the TryHackMe AttackBox

Looking at the top of the page, press the "Start AttackBox" button to deploy the TryHackMe AttackBox that we will be interacting with. The TryHackMe AttackBox is a Ubuntu Linux machine that is hosted online in the cloud and can be interacted with via your browser. You will be using this to interact with the machine that you deploy in this task.


Using SSH to Login to Your Linux Machine

The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:

1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

For this room, we will be logging in as "tryhackme", whose password is "tryhackme" without the quotation ("") marks. Let's use the IP address of the machine displayed in the card at the top of the room as the IP address and this user, to construct a command to log in to the remote machine using SSH. The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine.

But first, we need to open a terminal on the TryHackMe AttackBox. There is an icon placed on the desktop named "Terminal". And now, we can proceed to input commands.

For example: `ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP ` . Replacing the IP address with the IP address for your Linux target machine. Once executed, we will then be asked to trust the host and then provide a password for the "`tryhackme`" account, which is also `"tryhackme`".


## flags and switches

A majority of commands allow for arguments to be provided. These arguments are identified by a hyphen and a certain keyword known as flags or switches.

We'll later discuss how we can identify what commands allow for arguments to be provided and understanding what these do exactly.

When using a command, unless otherwise specified, it will perform its default behaviour. For example, `ls` lists the contents of the working directory. However, hidden files are not shown. We can use flags and switches to extend the behaviour of commands.

Using our `ls` example, `ls` informs us that there is only one folder named "folder1" as highlighted in the screenshot below. Note that the contents in the screenshots below are only examples.

```bash
ls

ls -a

ls --help

man ls
```

The manual pages are a great source of information for both system commands and applications available on both a Linux machine, which is accessible on the machine itself and [online](https://linux.die.net/man/).

To access this documentation, we can use the `man` command and then provide the command we want to read the documentation for. Using our ls example, we would use `man ls` to view the manual pages for `ls` 

```
What directional arrow key would we use to navigate down the manual page?

down

What flag would we use to display the output in a "human-readable" way?

-h
```


## filesystem continued

We covered some of the most fundamental commands when interacting with the filesystem on the Linux machine. For example, we covered how to list and find the contents of folders using `ls` and `find` and navigating the filesystem using `cd`. 

In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:

- create files and folders
- move files and folders
- delete files and folders

More specifically, the following commands:

```
Command	    Full Name	      Purpose
touch	    touch	          Create file
mkdir	    make directory	  Create a folder
cp	        copy	          Copy a file or folder
mv	        move	          Move a file or folder
rm	        remove	          Remove a file or folder
file	    file	          Determine the type of a file
```

Creating Files and Folders (touch, mkdir)

Creating files and folders on Linux is a simple process. First, we'll cover creating a file. The touch command takes exactly one argument -- the name we want to give the file we create. For example, we can create the file "note" by using touch note. It's worth noting that touch simply creates a blank file. You would need to use commands like echo or text editors such as nano to add content to the blank file.

```shell
touch note

mkdir mydirectory
```

Removing Files and Folders (rm)

rm is extraordinary out of the commands that we've covered so far. You can simply remove files by using rm. However, you need to provide the -R switch alongside the name of the directory you wish to remove.

```shell
rm note
ls

rm -R mydirectory
ls
```


Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)

Copying and moving files is an important functionality on a Linux machine. Starting with cp, this command takes two arguments:

1. the name of the existing file
2. the name we wish to assign to the new file when copying

cp copies the entire contents of the existing file into the new file. In the screenshot below, we are copying "note" to "note2".

```shell
cp note note2
ls

mv note2 note3
ls
```

Determining File Type

What is often misleading and often catches people out is making presumptions from files as to what their purpose or contents may be. Files usually have what's known as an extension to make this easier. For example, text files usually have an extension of ".txt". But this is not necessary.

So far, the files we have used in our examples haven't had an extension. Without knowing the context of why the file is there -- we don't really know its purpose. Enter the file command. This command takes one argument. For example, we'll use file to confirm whether or not the "note" file in our examples is indeed a text file, like so file note.

```shell
tryhackme@linux2:~$ file note 
note: ASCII text
```


```
How would you create the file named "newnote"?

touch newnote

On the deployable machine, what is the file type of "unknown1" in "tryhackme's" home directory?

ASCII text


How would we move the file "myfile" to the directory "myfolder"

mv myfile myfolder


What are the contents of this file?

THM{FILESYSTEM}
```



## permissions 101

As you would have already found out by now, certain users cannot access certain files or folders. We've previously explored some commands that can be used to determine what access we have and where it leads us. 

In our previous tasks, we learned how to extend the use of commands through flags and switches. Take, for example, the `ls` command, which lists the contents of the current directory. When using the `-l` switch, we can see ten columns such as in the screenshot below. However, we're only interested in the first three columns:

```shell
ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file1 
-rw-r--r-- 8 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file2
```

Although intimidating, these three columns are very important in determining certain characteristics of a file or folder and whether or not we have access to it. A file or folder can have a couple of characteristics that determine both what actions are allowed and what user or group has the ability to perform the given action -- such as the following:

- Read
- Write
- Execute

Briefly: The Differences Between Users & Groups

The great thing about Linux is that permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.

Let's put this into a real-world context; the system user that runs a web server must have permissions to read and write files for an effective web application. However, companies such as web hosting companies will have to want to allow their customers to upload their own files for their website without being the webserver system user -- compromising the security of every other customer. 

We'll learn the commands necessary to switch between users below.

Switching Between Users

Switching between users on a Linux install is easy work thanks to the `su` command. Unless you are the root user (or using root permissions through sudo), then you are required to know two things to facilitate this transition of user accounts:

The user we wish to switch to
The user's password
The `su` command takes a couple of switches that may be of relevance to you. For example, executing a command once you log in or specifying a specific shell to use. I encourage you to read the man page for` su` to find out more. However, I will cover the` -l` or `--login` switch.

Simply, by providing the `-l` switch to `su`, we start a shell that is much more similar to the actual user logging into the system - we inherit a lot more properties of the new user, i.e., environment variables and the likes. 

```shell
su user2
```
For example, when using `su` to switch to "user2", our new session drops us into our previous user's home directory.

```shell
tryhackme@linux2:~$ su -l user2 
Password: 
user2@linux2:~$ pwd 
user2@:/home/user2$
```


```
On the deployable machine, who is the owner of "important"?

user2

What would the command be to switch to the user "user2"?

su user2

Now switch to this user "user2" using the password "user2"
Output the contents of "important", what is the flag?

THM{SU_USER2}
```




## common directories

**/etc**

This root directory is one of the most important root directories on your system. The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system. 

For example, the sudoers file highlighted in the screenshot below contains a list of the users & groups that have permission to run sudo or a set of commands as the root user.

Also highlighted below are the "**passwd**" and "**shadow**" files. These two files are special for Linux as they show how your system stores the passwords for each user in encrypted formatting called sha512.

**/var**

The "/var" directory, with "var" being short for variable data,  is one of the main root folders found on a Linux install. This folder stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system. For example, log files from running services and applications are written here (**/var/log**), or other data that is not necessarily associated with a specific user (i.e., databases and the like).

/**root**

Unlike the **/home** directory, the **/root** folder is actually the home for the "root" system user. There isn't anything more to this folder other than just understanding that this is the home directory for the "root" user. But, it is worth a mention as the logical presumption is that this user would have their data in a directory such as "**/home/root**" by default.

**/tmp**

This is a unique root directory found on a Linux install. Short for "temporary", the /tmp directory is volatile and is used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Similar to the memory on your computer, once the computer is restarted, the contents of this folder are cleared out.

What's useful for us in pentesting is that any user can write to this folder by default. Meaning once we have access to a machine, it serves as a good place to store things like our enumeration scripts.


```
What is the directory path that would we expect logs to be stored in?

/var/log

What root directory is similar to how RAM on a computer works?

/tmp

Name the home directory of the root user

/root

```
