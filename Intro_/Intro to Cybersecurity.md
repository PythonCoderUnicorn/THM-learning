## Careers in Cyber
- security analyst
- security engineer
- incident responder
- digital forensics
- malware analyst
- penetration testing
- red team

## Defensive Security
- Preventing intrusions from occurring
- Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- SOC is team of security professionals that monitor the network & systems
- vulnerabilities (not necessarily assigned to SOC team)
- policy violations
- unauthorized activity
- network intrusions

### Digital forensics
- use of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.
Focus is on:
- `file system `= analyze systems storage (installed programs etc)
- `system memory` = if attacker is running malicious program in memory getting a forensic image of the system memory is used for analysis
- `system logs` = computer logs have info on what happened on a system, traces are left
- `network logs` = logs of network packets

### incident response
- incident = data breach, cyber attack, policy violation etc
- cyber attack include an attacker making our network or systems inaccessible
- defacing (changing) the public website
- data breach (stealing company data)

### 4 phases of incident response process:
1. preparation = a team trained for incidents, prevention measures
2. detection & analysis = resources to detect incident & analyze the severity of incident
3. containment, eradication, recovery = post detection now stop the spread to other systems
4. post-incident activity = recovery, report and lesson learned shared

### malware analysis
- malicious software includes:
- `virus` = code tat attaches itself to a program, spread from 1 computer, it alters + overwrites + deletes files on infected computer
- `trojan horse` = program that shows 1 desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath
- `ransomware` = malicious program that encrypts user's files, need encryption key
- malware analysis goal: learn about the malicious program
- static analysis = inspecting program without running it (need to know assembly language)
- dynamic analysis = run malware in controlled enviro and monitor activities (watch it work)
