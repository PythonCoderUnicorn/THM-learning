## What is a shell?

A shell is the interface using the command line environment.
- BASH
- cmd.exe
- Powershell (Windows)

targeting remote systems its possible to force an app on the server (webserver) to execute code and to use the initial access to get a shell running on the target.

- force remote server to send us command line access (reverse shell)
- open a port on server which then can be connected to, execute commands (bind shell)
