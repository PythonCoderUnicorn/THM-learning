## day 1 : SOC 

The website we are investigating is a Youtube to MP3 converter currently being shared amongst the organizers of SOC-mas. You've decided to dig deeper after hearing some concerning reports about this website.

From your AttackBox, access the website by visiting **MACHINE_IP** using the web browser.

Youtube to MP3 Converter Websites

These websites have been around for a long time. They offer a convenient way to extract audio from YouTube videos, making them popular. However, historically, these websites have been observed to have significant risks, such as:

- **Malvertising**: Many sites contain malicious ads that can exploit vulnerabilities in a user's system, which could lead to infection.
- **Phishing scams**: Users can be tricked into providing personal or sensitive information via fake surveys or offers.
- **Bundled malware**: Some converters may come with malware, tricking users into unknowingly running it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

1. pasting any YouTube link in the search form and pressing the "Convert" button
2.  select either `mp3 or mp4` option
3. downloads/ find `download.zip` right click > extract to , `song.mp3` 
4. in terminal `file song.mp3` then `file somg.mp3`

```
somg.mp3: MS Windows shortcut, Item id list present, Points to a file or directory, Has Relative path, Has Working directory, Has command line arguments, Archive, ctime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, mtime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, atime=Sat Sep 15 07:14:14 2018, length=448000, window=hide
```
The output tells us that instead of an MP3, the file is an "MS Windows shortcut", also known as a `.lnk` file. This file type is used in Windows to link to another file, folder, or application. These shortcuts can also be used to run commands!

6. `exiftool somg.mp3`

Powershell command
- `-ep Bypass -nop` flags disable PowerShell's usual restrictions, allowing scripts to run without interference from security settings or user profiles.
- The `DownloadFile` method pulls a file (in this case, `IS.ps1`) from a remote server ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1)) and saves it in the `C:\\ProgramData\\` directory on the target machine.
- script is executed with PowerShell using the `iex` command, which triggers the downloaded `s.ps1` file.
- The script is designed to collect highly sensitive information from the victim's system, such as cryptocurrency wallets and saved browser credentials, and send it to an attacker's remote server.

 OPSEC mistakes include:
- Reusing usernames, email addresses, or account handles across multiple platforms. One might assume that anyone trying to cover their tracks would remove such obvious and incriminating information, but sometimes, it's due to vanity or simply forgetfulness.
- Using identifiable metadata in code, documents, or images, which may reveal personal information like device names, GPS coordinates, or timestamps.
- Posting publicly on forums or GitHub (Like in this current scenario) with details that tie back to their real identity or reveal their location or habits.
- Failing to use a VPN or proxy while conducting malicious activities allows law enforcement to track their real IP address.

Looks like the song.mp3 file is not what we expected! Run "exiftool song.mp3" in your terminal to find out the author of the song. Who is the author? 

- `tyler ramsbey `

The malicious PowerShell script sends stolen info to a C2 server. What is the URL of this C2 server?
- `$c2Url =` 
- ` http://papash3ll.thm/data `

Who is M.M? Maybe his Github profile page would provide clues?

- mayor malware


## day 2 : logs 

 A SOC analyst then analyses the alert to identify if the alert is a True Positive (TP) or a False Positive (FP). An alert is considered a TP if it contains actual malicious activity. On the flip side, if the alert triggers because of an activity that is not actually malicious, it is considered an FP.

## day 11:  WPA wifi

Wi-Fi networks around us. This list comprises the access points (often the routers) that are broadcasting Wi-Fi signals with a unique **SSID** (network name)

 if you know the correct password, also known as a pre-shared key (**PSK**). Once you successfully connect to a network via Wi-Fi, you will be assigned an IP address inside that network

 a malicious actor from outside the organisation could still see the broadcasted Wi-Fi **SSID** of the organisation's network when they turn their Wi-Fi on.

some of the most popular techniques:

- **Evil twin attack:** In this attack, the attacker creates a fake access point that has a similar name to one of your trusted Wi-Fi access points.  users are likely to open the Wi-Fi access points list for troubleshooting and will find the attacker's Wi-Fi with almost similar name and with greater signal strength. They would go to connect it, and once connected, the attacker could see all their traffic to or from the Internet.
- **Rogue access point:** the attacker sets up an open Wi-Fi access point near or inside the organisation's physical premises to make it available to users with good signal strength. The attacker can intercept all their communication after the users connect to this rogue access point.
- **WPS attack:** Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) was created to allow users to connect to their Wi-Fi using an 8-digit PIN without remembering complex passwords. However, this 8-digit PIN is vulnerable in some networks due to its insecure configuration. The attack is made by initiating a WPS handshake with the router and capturing the router's response, which contains some data related to the PIN and is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Some of the captured data is brute-forced, and the PIN is successfully extracted along with the Pre-Shared Key (PSK).
- **WPA/WPA2 cracking:** Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was created to secure wireless communication. It uses a strong encryption algorithm. However, the security of this protocol is heavily influenced by the length and complexity of the Pre-Shared Key (PSK). While cracking WPA, attackers start by sending de-authentication packets to a legitimate user of the Wi-Fi network. Once the user disconnects, they try to reconnect to the network, and a 4-way handshake with the router takes place during this time. Meanwhile, the attacker turns its adaptor into monitor mode and captures the handshake. After the handshake is captured, the attacker can crack the password by using brute-force or dictionary attacks on the captured handshake file.

WPA/WPA2 cracking begins by listening to Wi-Fi traffic to capture the 4-way handshake between device and access point 
 deauthentication packets are sent to disconnect a client, forcing it to reconnect and initiate a new handshake (captured)
 attacker tries to brute force the password on the handshake file 

1. attacker places wireless adapter into monitor mode to scan for networks, then targets specific network to grab the 4 way handshake
2. once have handshake run a bruteforce attack using `aircrack-ng` 

4 way handshake :

1. router sends a challenge to the client asking it to prove it knows the password without sharing it 
2. client responds with encrypted info that only the router can verify
3. router verifies and send confirmation 
4. final check and connection established, secure connection

vulnerability lies in capturing handshake data for password cracking 

```
# ssh session, shows any wireless devices and their config
iw dev

# interface/ device
wlan2
# the MAC/BSSID (basic service set ID), unique each device

# scan for devices nearby    dev wlan2 = wireless devices
sudo iw dev wlan2 scan      

```

- The presence of **RSN (Robust Security Network)** indicates the network is using WPA2, as RSN is a part of the WPA2 standard. WPA2 networks typically use RSN to define the encryption and authentication settings.
- The `Group and Pairwise ciphers` are **CCMP**. Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) is the encryption method used by WPA2.
- `Authentication suites` value inside RSN is **PSK** indicating that this is a WPA2-Personal network, where a shared password is used for authentication.
- `DS Parameter set` value, which shows **channel 6**. The channel, in terms of Wi-Fi, refers to a specific frequency range within the broader Wi-Fi spectrum that allows wireless devices to communicate with each other.
	- The two most common Wi-Fi channels are 2.4 GHz and 5GHz. 
	- In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used because they don’t overlap, minimising interference. 
	- In the 5 GHz band, there are many more channels available, allowing more networks to coexist without interference.

**monitor** mode. 
This is a special mode primarily used for network analysis and security auditing. In this mode, the Wi-Fi interface listens to all wireless traffic on a specific channel, regardless of whether it is directed to the device or not.

## day 12:  race condition vulnerabilities

In its simplest form, a web timing attack means we glean information from a web application by reviewing how long it takes to process our request. By making tiny changes in what we send or how we send it and observing the response time, we can access information we are not authorised to have.

Race conditions are a subset of web timing attacks that are even more special. With a race condition attack, we are no longer simply looking to gain access to information but can cause the web application to perform unintended actions on our behalf.

web timing attacks between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is that HTTP/2 supports a feature called single-packet multi-requests. Network latency, the amount of time it takes for the request to reach the web server, made it difficult to identify web timing
with single-packet multi-requests, we can stack multiple requests in the same TCP packet, eliminating network latency from the equation

timing attacks:
- info disclosure , uncover info 
- race conditions 
- `Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)` flaw.

## day 13:  websockets 

WebSockets let your browser and the server keep a constant line of communication open.

regular HTTP, your browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds, then closes the connection
WebSockets handle things differently. Once the connection is established, it remains open, allowing the server to push updates to you whenever there’s something new.

common vulnerabilities:
- **Weak Authentication and Authorisation:** Unlike regular HTTP, WebSockets don't have built-in ways to handle user authentication or session validation. If you don't set these controls up properly, attackers could slip in and get access to sensitive data or mess with the connection.
- **Message Tampering:** WebSockets let data flow back and forth constantly, which means attackers could intercept and change messages if encryption isn't used. This could allow them to inject harmful commands, perform actions they shouldn't, or mess with the sent data.
- **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** This happens when an attacker tricks a user's browser into opening a WebSocket connection to another site. If successful, the attacker might be able to hijack that connection or access data meant for the legitimate server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Because WebSocket connections stay open, they can be targeted by DoS attacks. An attacker could flood the server with a ton of messages, potentially slowing it down or crashing it altogether.

WebSocket Message Manipulation is when an attacker intercepts and changes the messages sent between a web app and its server.

- **Doing Things Without Permission:** If someone can tamper with WebSocket messages, they could impersonate another user and carry out unauthorised actions such as making purchases, transferring funds, or changing account settings.
- **Gaining Extra Privileges:** Attackers could also manipulate messages to make the system think they have more privileges than they actually do. This could let them access admin controls, change user data, view sensitive info, or mess with system settings.
- **Messing Up Data:** One of the significant risks is data corruption. If someone is changing the messages, they could feed bad data into the system. This could mess with user accounts, transactions, or anything else the app handles.
- **Crashing the System:** An attacker could also spam the server with bad requests, causing it to slow down or crash.

## day 14: certificate management 

- **Public key**: At its core, a certificate contains a public key, part of a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone and is used to encrypt data.
- **Private key**: The private key remains secret and is used by the website or server to decrypt the data.
- **Metadata**: Along with the key, it includes metadata that provides additional information about the certificate holder (the website) and the certificate. You usually find information about the Certificate Authority (CA), subject (information about the website, e.g. www.meow.thm), a uniquely identifiable number, validity period, signature, and hashing algorithm.

A CA is a trusted entity that issues certificates; for example, GlobalSign, Let’s Encrypt, and DigiCert are very common ones.

- handshake = browser requests a secure connection , website sends a certificate 
- verification = browser checks certificate if issued by certificate authority 
- key exchange = browser used public key to encrypt a session key (all communication)
- decryption = website server uses private key to decrypt session (symmetric)

- **Browsers** generally do not trust self-signed certificates because there is no third-party verification. The browser has no way of knowing if the certificate is authentic or if it’s being used for malicious purposes (like a **man-in-the-middle attack**).
- **Trusted CA certificates**, on the other hand, are verified by a CA, which acts as a trusted third party to confirm the website’s identity.

## day 18: prompt injection 

- **Data Poisoning:** As we discussed, an AI model is as good as the data it is trained on. Therefore, if some malicious actor introduces inaccurate or misleading data into the training data of an AI model while the AI is being trained or when it is being fine-tuned, it can lead to inaccurate results. 
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** If not properly sanitised, AI models can often provide output containing sensitive information such as proprietary information, personally identifiable information (PII), Intellectual property, etc. For example, if a clever prompt is input to an AI chatbot, it may disclose its backend workings or the confidential data it has been trained on.
- **Prompt Injection:** Prompt injection is one of the most commonly used attacks against LLMs and AI chatbots. In this attack, a crafted input is provided to the LLM that overrides its original instructions to get output that is not intended initially, similar to control flow hijack attacks against traditional systems.

## day 21 :  reverse engineering

Reverse Engineering (RE) is the process of breaking something down to understand its function. In cyber security, reverse engineering is used to analyse how applications (binaries) function. This can be used to determine whether or not the application is malicious or if there are any security bugs present.

https://youtu.be/K-oowwtK_8Q

Windows binaries follow the Portable Executable (PE) structure, whereas on Linux, binaries follow the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).

- **A code section:** This section contains the instructions that the CPU will execute
- **A data section:** This section contains information such as variables, resources (images, other data), etc
- **Import/Export tables:** These tables reference additional libraries used (imported) or exported by the binary. Binaries often rely on libraries to perform functions. For example, interacting with the Windows API to manipulate files

1. **Stage 1 - Dropper:** This binary is usually a lightweight, basic binary responsible for actions such as enumerating the operating system to see if the payload will work. Once certain conditions are verified, the binary will download the second - much more malicious - binary from the attacker's infrastructure.
2. **Stage 2 - Payload:** This binary is the "meat and bones" of the attack. For example, in the event of ransomware, this payload will encrypt and exfiltrate the data.

## day 24: communication protocols IoT

MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a language very commonly used in IoT devices for communication purposes.

**MQTT Clients:** MQTT clients are IoT devices, such as sensors and controllers, that publish or subscribe to messages using the MQTT protocol.

**MQTT Broker:** An MQTT broker receives messages from publishing clients and distributes them to the subscribing clients based on their preferences.

**MQTT Topics:** Topics are used to classify the different types of messages.
